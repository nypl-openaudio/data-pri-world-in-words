00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So tell me when you want me to start go for it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The world in words is made possible in parts by the National Endowment for the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Humanities celebrating fifty years of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
excellence

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with Patrick Cox And you're listening to the world and well talk us about languages and the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
people who today Patrick as you know we have a name tag

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
story name tags are occasional series on the stories behind place names.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Patrick before we get into the story actually have a little name tag quiz for us to try out

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
first and you should do pretty well this Patrick because it's a quiz concerning the pronunciation

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of town names around Norfolk.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Oh yeah yeah no fuck I went to college in north of the University of East Anglia which gives

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
you a sense of the geography of it is that sort of that sticks out above

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
London into the North Sea. Yeah.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So we're talking North Folk England here and not virgin yeah OK so how this is going to work is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm going to spell out the town

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
name and you're just going to tell me how it's pronounced in North.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yeah like how the north north. You know folk

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
humans would the people of North Dakota. He would know.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Would say this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
name the any pronunciation I could do for people from North we would kind of

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
loss about the local accent.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It was just this one line you going down the pub. That's

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
it you go in down the path. It was kind of slow and then it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
rose at the end of the like the back said this is the kind of local accent.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You know or yeah so that we would say that to each other for a bubbly on a nightly

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
basis is the just Anglian accent. Yeah maybe a specific knows that when I don't

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
know you go in down the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
pub. OK I said you know. A piece of paper and a pen to write these

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
down show. OK I'm ready. OK The first

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
one it is spelled W Y

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
M O N D H A

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
M Oh yeah I know this place because we used to go to parties here in my

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
friend Reinhart's rotten red runaround Hans Roman red rhino. If you sat in

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the passenger seat and got out of the door. That's why you took the door with you it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
wasn't attached to the rest. So

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
you're driving around Norfolk in the rotten red red no.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Yes And and we would go to parties in this town Wyndham is how it's

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
pronounced being the new window when you're at

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
one point and I think I remember it specifically because I'm guessing anyway

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
because I've got the strong images of my knowledge from right. Otherwise I'm

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
afraid when I can't remember in any other

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
way to me it looks like women and ham. Yeah right think we must

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
we must look down through this for the first time we went then correct. OK So there

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
are so many good ones but I mean to give

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you this next. OK OK. S T

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I S S K

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
E Y and I hope everybody out there is also playing along. I asked

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
ask you why.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
OK so it looks like it's pronounced this key but it clearly isn't

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
so what shall I say it's

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
lucky.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm leaving it's Stookey Stookey I really just get rid of

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I.F.'s Stookey to get rid of the I asked. Yeah. So

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
it's like Stookey OK Let me let me see.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
T A

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
C O L N E S T O

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and so it's a village in south Norfolk T

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
A L. And he S T O

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and oh my goodness. When you said a C.E.O.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
talk. I don't like this but I was like

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
yeah but but they were very far from

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
anyplace making tacos and the calls. I don't even know how you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
would pronounce it if you were just doing it in the standard English why such

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
angle nested talks than Truxton How about that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Tackle stone.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Oh for goodness sake do you really

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
fast tackle nest and tackle so and tackle nest and tackle stone tackle stone.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
OK final one. I'm one for three or one for three.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
OK final one and you an

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
D.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
S. L. e Y.. So again that's an un D E

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
S L E Y.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So so again Coastal is a sort of oh well it's quite possible I went there we went

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to the comes quite a lot.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Mum does Lee Mundus Lee would be sort of an outsider's guess but

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
it clearly isn't otherwise it wouldn't have made your dusted Lee

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
live money monthly.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Oh my God ding ding day really totally got its monthly I think I'm getting

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
a pass on here but it. They just sort of drop some middle syllable or

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
two but you turn the ass into you which is very smart

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
monthly monthly I can figure out any of these these all come from an article by the way where

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
this news organization got. One of their foreign reporters to try and pronounce all of

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
these village names and he did it hardly wrong and it's

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
so funny AN Yway. So Patrick did you know there's actually

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
a term for this kind of study of

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
me I do know on I'm ology I

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
don't watch it. I'll stick

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
onomastics Yash is the president of the English Police me and

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
society is a group of academics. And regular folks who just nerd out about

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
names. In the names of towns and villages which haven't really changed for centuries. You

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
can read the whole history of the country it's it's really fascinating from that point of

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
view like the eighth and ninth century the period when the Vikings came to the British

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Isles due to for self is a professor of Viking studies at the University of

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Nottingham and she fell in love with the Nordic warriors and medieval

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
history as a teenager.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I'd read my talking a lot of fight evil to start out as sounds of talking.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I like that it all started with talk

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and I can't stand them now but

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
nevertheless I'm not ashamed

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to admit that that's kind of where I started off with fourteen year

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
old Judith went on to learn old Norse she studies runes

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
she also studies place

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
names you know I'm interested in all aspects of the Viking age and one of the most

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
important bits of evidence for Vikings in the British Isles

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
certainly is the really quite large number of Scandinavian

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
place names.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Oh so it's almost like we're back in Norfolk again or at least up and down

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the Eastern English coast because that was where a load of those Viking

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
names stuck right. Write all of those names and be

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
why Mary Magdalene Yang Grimsby if Old Norse is the same

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
as modern Norwegian and Danish B Y means town.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And then there's also up in

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Yorkshire the Yorkshire Dales which are sort of valleys the word

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
de L.D.L. means Valley and in Old Norse Well I

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
don't know already knew you know you have a shins of it so you

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
can see a lot of how the Vikings came to the British Isles through just the names of the towns that

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
stuck getting back to that nor folkways that I gave you and the

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
pronunciation of place names. There's another thing that I chatted. With Judith that was really

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
interesting and it was about

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
how actually pronunciation can influence the naming of a

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
place so we have a place here near noshing I'm called Fisker

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Chian and it was originally a village of fishermen so should

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
the fish or

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
chicken but in the Old Norse language the word for fish is

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Fisk and the word for a fisherman is fifth grade. So you get discouraged

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
but instead of fish which you know it's an English thing but it was pronounced by the Scandinavian encumbers

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
with their schedule maybe an accent. If you like and it's retained that pronunciation.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So fish written. Became Fisker to and because of the way some Vikings pronounced it

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
like centuries

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
ago. Well that's all. Some Yeah on the word Fisk today in Danish in the way

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Jinn's they go. Which brings me to our story today so I

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
first started thinking about pronunciation and place names a few years ago when

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I went to visit the small New Hampshire town. It's like way way up north in the

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
great northern woods near the Canadian

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
border it spelt B R L I N So

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Patrick how do you think you would pronounce that.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Oh no this is another. Well I

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
would pronounce it the way the the well known for the capital of Germany is

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
printed right. But that's clearly wrong otherwise you wouldn't be asking me.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Lyn Berlin. No no. Totally wrong. While it is spelled like

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the German capital. It's not pronounced Berlin it's pronounced Berlin. You

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
know and this is on the first syllable is a very very subtle Berlin not

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Berland Berlin. I mean people will correct you up there. They will correct you will

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
they correct.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
But when it's from Jim I suppose. I mean because they're not

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
in Berlin. They're in Berlin. So I would got curious about why this name

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and why this pronunciation and so I called up

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
some experts. You can say Historical Society my legal speaking.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Hello always told me. In was actually originally named Maine's

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
borough A Y N E S

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
B R O U G H.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Maine's

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
borough in eight hundred twenty nine the town change his name to Berlin. As for the pronunciation.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Well you didn't know much.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And that's not something that I have any documentation on. I

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
mean Concord is pronounced differently than Concord. Yeah

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
it could just be a regional accent it's

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
well to get to the bottom of this. It seems that I needed to ask

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
real Berlin

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
or so we

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
did

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
OK is a question that I should

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
know but I don't know why they didn't do it Berlin in

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Berlin and said I don't know it's so confusing and that Murtha hit bottom on main street in Berlin.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.000
She's not

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
actually from there. She happens to be from the neighboring town

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
of Milan and I L A

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and people call it. So I think maybe it's just this area that can't be pronounced.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I'm not sure

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Berlin not a big place somewhere you know between a couple mountains behind you know a couple trees

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.000
behind a

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
boulder Berlin was once a bustling log and saw mill town the endless Goggin

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
river cuts through the heart of the town talking to folks on Main Street who seem to

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
be as many

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
theories as are Berliners I

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
mean Berliners I know around World War One there was a yeah chanted

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
German movement and things that were had German names

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
were changed. So I think Berland probably got

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.000
this

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
production at the time to kind

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
of attempt to diminish the Germanic.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Impression but I

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
don't know I'm going to say probably generating the

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
French you know because the French population here back in the day. Everybody's. You

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
know someone has a problem because of that it's why it's called What It

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Is I guess it depends on where you're from and what your act is all about

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
the guy that. Like I used to live in Bangor a lot of people from out

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
of town called Bangor or really

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Bangalore by Berlin I don't know I guess to know where you're

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
from there's one man in

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
town guaranteed to know the truth. I was

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
told by Maryland resident

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
historian Paul. Hi nice to me oh

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
yeah my girlfriends the

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
the

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Paul has his own unique name booth. You can walk around Berlin

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and ask people if they know Paul Todd if they don't know but if you ask if

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
they know Paul of course I know

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Poff What's the story. What's the story as as you know it to

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
be fact when you want to know for a fact.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
OK The Plautus I know about Brolin becoming barrel on

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
his drummer all is nothing.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Poof doesn't know.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
So it's unknown whether you were named after the German town or if you were

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
named after another town in New England

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
or that's right it's on known and my research shows

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
that it's unknown poofs comb through archives and books. No

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
definitive evidence no smoking gun. There's just a little clue about

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
its pronunciation what I

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
found is that the Yankees that first came

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
here once they changed the name from Israel to Berlin their

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
pronunciation was on the first syllable. Burl and not on the

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
second syllable. OK I was a bit skeptical but then poof told me something

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
interesting there are actually four Berlin's in New England and all four of

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
them have the same pronunciation. Weird. I thought I just have to go to

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.000
another

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
one so I went just outside of Boston to Berlin

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Massachusetts and there I met the poof Tardif of Berlin Massachusetts his name is a

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Barry Yeager and he is the chairman of Berlin Massachusetts

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Historical Society.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
My family has been in those in Berlin since this time began the ancestors of mine that were

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
here at the time that the time was

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
incorporated in seventeen eighty four and seventy four the

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Berlin mass was named in seventeen eighty four in the wake of the Revolutionary

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
War and in those raw few years after the war Yankees

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
did not want to name their new towns after the English.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
It's likely that a German name was picked rather than English name because of

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
feelings toward Burton at that

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
time no German so that you know of in the area.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
No there was never any significant German immigrant population here. It was

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
all Yankees that were here at the time. And so they Anglo size the

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.000
name

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
immediately.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Instead of the way it sounded most natural and you're just

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
pleased we have a deed in our historical collection from

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
the year seven hundred eighty

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
four that spells the name of the town be a R L

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I N G. Officially it was spelled B E R L I N From the

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
beginning in the act of the legislature it was spelled the same as

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
the capital of Germany. However it was

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
not pronounced that way by the locals and because they didn't pronounce it that way.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
It led to people writing it in the way that they were hearing it. And that's where that

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
misspelling in the date comes. So from the very beginning the local settlers

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Angua

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
sized the word surlily and made it very well known violent from the

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.000
very

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
beginning.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So back in Berlin New Hampshire today. You're more likely to

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
hear the remnants of a French accent. Many of the town's residents are the descendants of

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
French speaking loggers who came to work the sawmills and log the great north

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
woods and you can actually see French history in some of the street names like the Black Sea

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Air St sorry murder that pronunciation. But it roughly translates to

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
man of the woods French though unlike the theory that you heard earlier in

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
the story doesn't seem to have much to do with how the town

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
pronounces its German name.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Incidentally the town did briefly flirt with the idea of changing its name during

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
World War One according to poof

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
tardive eclipse the newspaper from February fourteenth Valentine's

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Day one thousand nine hundred eighteen. I wonder if you might read this with the headline that I can.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
This was from the Brawn reporter Brolan Hampshire Thursday February fourteenth ID an

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
eighteen a change was advocated by many Berlin citizens.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
We do not object to the name Brolan but we do object to the horrors on

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
the frightfulness in its connection with the Imperial German government.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Let us respect the honor and man one of our boys in the trenches. What

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
do you say citizens of Berlin about a change what

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
is in a

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
name the town didn't change its name.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Not even temporarily in the end is going to be too much of a bureaucratic

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
nightmare and job or line. The main Berlin the

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Franco American town with a German name and changing pronunciation.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Thank

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
you ma'am and I will have to

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
acknowledge let me give you I know it now for you.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
He was really baby.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Johnny Rotten Tomatoes the

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
software that ate a cola belt

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
may be a cat that

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
she didn't like it was shipped back to I got it there

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
are all the fit to see it when

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
his teeth that he wanted

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
a GET HIS enough that he never came out

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000
in Auschwitz show. Oh shit man again.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I wish you'd asked me how to pronounce Pluto. I would be most up on

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
it that's like the best nickname ever he actually gave me a whole story about how he

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
became

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
names. It was actually the nickname his dad who could tell stories about hunting and

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
when he would like shoot the gun you would go poof boop boop boop and so the

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
nicknamed of us will see you. Strictly speaking his post Jr He's tough to yeah he's

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
in his

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
junior puff piece I must admit when I first moved to New England I was

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
very confused. I think a lot of English people particularly confuse when they

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
go to New England because they see all these towns that they think they know how to

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
pronounce

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
and they're bit different like you know like about lemon but the towns in England for the

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
most part. And so it's really confusing to English people because suddenly you're confronted by

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
a different pronunciation sometimes slightly different spelling as

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
well so there's this Woburn right Matthew Ruben mass right.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Why is it pronounced Woo is a single Oh that. So should be like whoa burn should be

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
well been which is what the good name of the town. I believe the town in England is

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
pronounced

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
well but actually got corrected on Woburn when I first moved here I was like whoa Byrne. What

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
are you

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
talking in a town called

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Welborn Reuben it's a Hebrew burn Do you really think that they should either have to sell the law or say

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
she lived. Yes.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
W B U R N or Wu woo we know but

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
I'll tell you you remember and there was another one a little bit north of

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Wilburn call Bill Rekha this one is totally with it so it's B I

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
L L T

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I see a bill or echo bellow wrecker. But they got rid of the

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
either just that that just gets dropped from the pronunciation so they'd lose a syllable

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Bill

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Rekha but the town in England that they borrowed it from is Bill or Ricky.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
So it's the same spelling with a Y at the end the Recchi in

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Essex. Oh yeah. It actually should be a bill or a K. right because isn't

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
a Y.A.Y.. Although although I think I think the Brits pronounce

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
it below Ricky bill or Bill or Ricky. Yeah it's nice and in fact it's

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
so pleasant sounding that Ian Dury the singer he did a very

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
famous song called Bill Ricky

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Dickie Good evenin. I'm from Essex police you couldn't

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
tell my Given I am is Jackie O. I come from below Ricky.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And all due in there

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.000
you

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
were

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000

directly as a kind of thing

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
I think you know I thought I just noticed the

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:47.000
stuff

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
in the air

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
