00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi It's Patrick Cox here and the last time we did a thing in the Paul cast about learning the

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
language of your enemy. It was about two sets of people who knew

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
virtually

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
nothing about each other's language and culture. The British

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the Japanese the British during World War two in a great panic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Needed To Train Up a few people to learn Japanese because well

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.000
no one in

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Britain understood Japanese they didn't understand what the enemy was

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
saying but in the pockets today it's the opposite a maybe a more

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
common situation. It's when you're right next door to your

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
enemy like in the Middle East Palestinians and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Israelis and when Palestinians learn Hebrew and Israelis learn

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Arabic the not just learning the language of the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
enemy the way they teach Arabic in the Army. It's actually for you know that

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
enemy in order for you to be able to stop the next explosion was an act that we always say

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that you tend to forget that it's a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
language that's also a part of a system which is alive and which

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is something that has to do with

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
people she is very enthusiastic about learning Hebrew and when I asked her why she said

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that in Gaza a lot of the cosmetic products the labels are in

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Hebrew and she said she cats buying shampoo for dry hair and then she

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
would wash her hair and her hair kept coming out really bad and she knew that she was using

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the wrong type of shampoo for her dry hair and now she knows Hebrew

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and she go shopping and she looks at the label

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of Israel and the territories and countries around it. These are places where people

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
have a huge amount in common they share habits and share recipes and share

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
music in this case a song sung in Arabic by three women of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Yemeni background has recently been a huge hit in

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Israel. Yes.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Shana Sheely is a reporter who spent some of the last year in the Middle East She's also spent a lot of time

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
studying the history and culture of the Middle

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
East and of course she's come across many many points of cultural contact

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
between Israelis and Arabs.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Shayna has also met two linguists who study the quote

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
enemies language two guys who are. Authorities on each other's languages who

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
live just a few dozen miles away from each other one in Israel the other

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
in Gaza the Israeli linguist Arik said on

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
China first met him at Hebrew University in Jerusalem in two thousand and thirteen she

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
was studying for a master's degree in islamic a Middle Eastern

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Studies and are Exadata was my Arabic

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
teacher and he was my first Arabic

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
teacher and just be clear he's Jewish right he is not an

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Arab correct our accident is Jewish he has a really light skin and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
he's tall and lanky he has long arms. Really like

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
green eyes and his cheeks are

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
rosy zone after if I had his son.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Here he is teaching an Arabic class in Jerusalem. He said on the research specialty is

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Arabic so use of the subjective tense something he just happens to be one of the world's authorities

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
thought yeah he's this pretty nerdy

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
mamma said and chose to study Arabic in seventh grade. He was

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
lucky to have an inspirational teacher a man who Sudan says lived the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
language he brought in John which is that which has Arabic

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
coffee and he drank a lot if not something like.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And everyone laughed and then he expected the laughter and said what I was laughing about. This is the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
way Arabs train they enjoy coffee not like huge

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
youth after his first Arabic lesson the twelve year old Saddam made a toy out of plastic

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
googly eyes glued onto cardboard in a fuzzball he. It to his mother drawer a after

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
writing an inscription in two languages.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It will suck but he's me not that he'll halting

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
hable follow my mother always love butting out of

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the well it's really unusual. Why an adult

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
the Dr says other family members and friends have to question his decision to study and

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
then make a career out of

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Arabic. They know him that he can study what it's really like appeal

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to physics mathematics.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
They always say. So it's not their only optic Yes No

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I told them that I know of

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the not just the language but how it works. That's been Siddons interest.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And how close it is to his native tongue Hebrew the two languages share many root words

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and follow similar grammatical patterns.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
He chose the same way of thinking and it shows the way that

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the people speaking these languages can be actually closer to each other

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.000
like the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
languages Saddam says he was lucky to learn Arabic in the eighty's when Jews and Arabs had

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
more chances to meet now though the status of Arabic has changed. Although it's

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
an official language in Israel fewer Jewish Israelis study it Sudan believes

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that Jews are turning their backs on a language that used to be central to their

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
culture thousand years ago Jews and Arabs work together

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
compared the Biblical scriptures.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Discuss things in Arabic.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
If a person says that Arabic is a lousy language. It means that the heritage of

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
this person the Jewish person is also lousy because the Jewish heritage a great

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
percentage of

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
it is Arabic. So there's this strong connection Shayna

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
between Arabic and Hebrew just like he says but but fewer Hebrew speakers learning Arabic.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
That seems amazing even in spite of all of the conflict Arabs and

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Israelis have lived in each other's pockets for so long. So who

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
now in Israel is learning Arabic.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So by twelfth grade at the end of their education only three percent of

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Israeli students take their matriculation exams in the subject so it's a very small group of people

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
who study Arabic in high

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
school and many of them choose to study Arabic because they want

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
to be placed in certain units during their mandatory army

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
service. That's interesting so with a trying to avoid active

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
duty Is that part of the deal here that you know they have the possibility of getting a desk job

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
instead if they learn

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Arabic possibly and also a job in

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
intelligence or security in the Army is a little bit more prestigious than some of the other

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
jobs so that's also a possibility.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I spoke with many of our Saddam's current students in university all of them

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
started studying Arabic in high school with the motivation to do

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Arabic in the Army but

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
now a lot of them have changed once you start studying Arabic in university. It's a

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
little bit different our exit and does not teach his students militarised

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Arabic

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
he teaches more about the grammar and he teaches from

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
literary sources. He uses the Qur'an in his curriculum.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
One of Sudan's students I spoke with his name is Yana tan. He's twenty

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
six and he started studying Arabic in high school so that he could be in

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
an intelligence unit during his army

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
service the way they teach make in the army is actually for know

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that enemy in order for you to be able to stop the next explosion was an act that we

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
always say that you tend to forget that it's a

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
language that's also a part of a system which is alive and which

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
is something that has to do with

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
people after he finished his army service here in a town went to university and met Arabs in

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Sudan syntax class and he

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
changed until that time I always thought of them as. The Arabs that hate

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Jews and because I learned that there's a different our I saw the need

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
for me to learn the language and to see what they really think. And if they do think

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
badly of us then maybe I could influence them and can convince them otherwise.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
That's the kind of attitude Saddam is trying to foster in his students. You can't be a

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
good linguist he says if your starting point is to stereotype groups of people.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I think it's important that an opinion which is really

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
racist is to say old you are or or Arabs

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
are it doesn't make sense in languages you can never say always it's like this or never it's like

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
this language isn't like life.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So Don can always get visas to travel to conferences abroad especially in parts of the Arab

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
world where Israelis are not welcome. Even experts on Arabic and he gets

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that many Israeli Arabic speakers who look like him learned Arabic for security and intelligence.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
So he understands that colleagues abroad may be suspicious of him but Saddam just wishes

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
more Israeli Jews would embrace this fascinating

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
language. I sometimes say is a joke or is a bad joke or

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
said joke that I only wish to Him to people in the Arab people would be

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
a bit close as that language is only ten percent because if the language

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
is at home in Israel to sit on says he sometimes feels intimidated.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I ask him how he feels intimidated

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
by my people are only Jewish people today

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
unlike ten or twenty or thirty years ago the Arabic language is considered

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
the language of the enemy and if you speak Arabic. It might be solely mean that you are part of

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
the enemy which is ridiculous.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Earlier this year Saddam made a presentation at a conference in Belgium. There was a

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
scholar there from Lebanon. The two bonded over what else language.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The Lebanese linguists found some ancient Hebrew manuscripts in a library in

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Beirut Sudan helped him translate them and after that they. Vowed to stay in touch.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
They exchanged e-mail addresses G. mail of course writing to each other's

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
institutional addresses might cause trouble.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
They laughed about the underhand arrangement but it was a poignant

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
moment the recognition that even the most innocent trading of

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:30.000
linguistic ideas was subject to the rules of the Arab Israeli conflict.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
well I guess it's good to hear that you know there are always ways of getting around these

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
these rather silly official impediments. But it really is crazy that

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
there are such impediments and I wonder Shana is it becoming worse is it becoming

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
more

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
difficult for our accident. To have these kinds of contacts with

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
his counterparts these linguists from the Arab world.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
You know I don't really have a great sense of if it's becoming more difficult

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
for

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Sadan I did speak with many of his Israeli colleagues who teach Arabic.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And many of them were concerned about the growing limitations force a

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
done as his career progresses an interesting thing when

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I started doing this story and I go to journalism school so

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I was pitching the story to classmates and professors and they always asked

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
me Well is he in the Mossad and I was like No he

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
just loves Arabic and they're like

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
really just to clarify the Mossad is the Israeli secret service.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Yes and I answer was of course not. Argh

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Stan loves Arabic he wants to teach this language to bring people closer

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
together and everyone was like How do you know that. How do you know he's not in

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Mossad and I think it's hard because people Israelis who study Arabic

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
who look like our exit on many of them. Do study for

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
intelligence and security so my sense is that it's

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
difficult for him but when he talks about it

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
he he's very humble he's pretty confident about his career he hasn't

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
run into any roadblocks yet and I think in a

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
way he understands that people are suspicious of him

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and he uses his knowledge of the language

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
to repair those suspicions.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So that begs the question what about the other side what about

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Arab academics Palestinian academics in particular

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
who have learned Hebrew who teach Hebrew. What about them.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So in Israel Gaza and the West Bank there are very few Palestinians who

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
teach Hebrew on an academic level when I started

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
this project. I set out to find our accidents counterpart.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I searched for Palestinians who are teaching Hebrew to Palestinians.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I have a friend her name is a beer. Ube. She's a journalist in

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Gaza and she writes for some Israeli publications so I know that she

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
knows Hebrew so I asked her how she knows Hebrew or if she knows any Hebrew teachers

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and she told me about so be Bihu so be battle is Gaza's

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
main Hebrew teacher. There are twelve Hebrew teachers in Gaza and so be

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
trained all of them.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
He studied Hebrew at Tel Aviv University received a Master's degree in two

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
thousand and two he is the only Gazan to study Hebrew at Tel Aviv University.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
He spoke about Hebrew in the same way that Sudan spoke about Arabic

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
which was this deep love of the language and of the patterns in the grammar and

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
the vocabulary which is so interesting to me because it's a language

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and I'm battling which

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
is that's sort of the the counterpart

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
thing that's. I think I mean you say you're bad at languages it sounds like these two

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
linguists both kind of bad about. I don't know Korea choice

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
or you know facts on the ground. So they both seem to be sort of living

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
in this incredibly admirable world of

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
adoring the other's native tongue but on the other hand

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
it's fraught with difficulty as

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
well yeah definitely and so be battle.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
He teaches so many Hebrew classes. He teaches private lessons

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
he teaches at a few universities in Gaza. And here's what Bihu will

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
says about his students who study Hebrew.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I encourage

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
all kinds of people of all

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
different categories and ages and colors political

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I mean. I encourage all of them. Because if you understand

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
your enemy. It helps and

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
facilitate that mission. Never mind invention is

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.000
a

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
military or socially or if you

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
question if we are standing each others its word.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So so be both rule he developed Gaza's entire Hebrew curriculum so he

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
had friends in Israel who would send him the

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Hebrew there called all pond books so his friends in Israel sent him those

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
books and by who built Gaza's Hebrew curriculum off of

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
these Israeli Hebrew books.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Now that's interesting and Israeli Hebrew books presumably are they

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
for outsiders or are they for Who are they aimed at there presumably not aimed

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
at Palestinians.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Right. So Israel's Hebrew cricket. It's for new immigrants to. Israel.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
A lot of Americans Russians Whatever people who move to Israel who want to learn Hebrew.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So there's been a lot of research on these books and how. Not only do they

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
teach the Hebrew language but also try to instill a sense

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
of Israeli nationhood

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
identity

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
history and pride and some of the narratives included in those

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
books are not narratives that are accepted throughout the

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
world especially throughout the Arab

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
world and so will had to modify these books

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
to fit the narrative and Gaza. So that

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
people who are learning Hebrew wouldn't become outraged by what they are reading

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
for example he says that the Islamic and Biblical narratives of the Passover story are

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
different but one of the cool things about using Israeli Hebrew books is that

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
a lot of them have cultural

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
references. It's important to Buffalo but his students learn those cultural references.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
He wants his students to know how to say Happy Holiday which is hugs the man

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
in Hebrew. He teaches his students how to say Shabat Scholem which is a greeting

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
said during the Sabbath in

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Israel what about his students were kind of students want to

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
learn Hebrew you know why of a why are they learning it.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Yes So. When I met with but who in Gaza. I also met with nine of his Hebrew

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
students and they had a lot of different motivations some of them were

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
journalists

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
businessmen some of them wanted to learn Hebrew so that they could be

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
teachers and most of them also recognize the importance of knowing Hebrew

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
for

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
self-defense many Gazans may

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
have interactions with Israeli soldiers and many of them believe that

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Hebrew can help them if they're in trouble so one of his students

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
whose name is Usher AFSPA Loesch he's forty and and he learned BASIC Hebrew

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
during his twenty one years and an Israeli

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
prison and now he studies behold to learn Hebrew more

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
formally when he was an. Prison he said that the Israelis

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
treated Palestinians not as if they were humans but as if they were bugs or

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.000
in

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
sex but in prison when he started to speak with his jailers and Hebrew he

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
said that something changed and they started respecting him and

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
they could talk about football and they could talk about things that they were watching on the T.V. and

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
it created a human relationship which did not exist

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
before

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
and Barlows recognizes the power of that and he wants

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
to arm Gaza and use with the skill. He said that he believes that

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
the level of hatred might go down if people talk to each other which I

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
think is the power of language that these two teachers

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
really

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
understand. Yeah that makes a huge difference. I mean the moment you can humanize a situation by

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
just being able

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
to speak the same language it's I mean it's a cliche but it really does seem

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
to work. I wonder if. If one who has come across this is well I mean

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
you mentioned that he started in Tel Aviv but since then he must have come

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
across as everybody who lives in Gaza does he must a come

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
across potentially violent confrontations

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
with Israeli guys in uniform.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Yet both will have this great story about this time during the second

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
intifada during which Israeli soldiers would come into

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Gaza and they had a policy of cleaning up the streets and

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
asking local residents to pick their trash up off the floor

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
and to scrub graffiti from the

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
walls and buffalo had an interesting encounter with some of the soldiers he

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
was renovating his apartment and had all this trash outside of his house

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
because they were completely redoing it and the soldiers drove

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
by and started banging on the door and asking him you know whose house

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
is this whose trash is this

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
and I thought. To speak evil. Are you going to

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
go as you say just a minute do speak a bow to yes or speak you.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
I am here both each of really you

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
know. Where did you learn how do you learn and therefore good the subject of this rubbish

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
on one of them the leader of the group he said OK you go and collect all of the people

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
and lead them to clean it and give

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
support and it led to this really funny

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
nice encounter which ultimately led to a lasting relationship in which

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
the soldiers came to his house and every time the soldiers were in the neighborhood

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
they'd come over and sit with bottle and drink coffee and chat in Hebrew.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Wow that's quite a story all made possible by a common language and

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
the signal that speaking that language

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
sense. Nowadays of course making that kind of connection is even

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
less possible. The Israeli soldiers A gone and they've also

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
sealed Gaza off from Israel. No conversations over T.V. between

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Palestinian civilians in Gaza and Israeli

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
soldiers and even less likely contacts between civilians living in

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Gaza and civilians in

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Israel so Shaena do you know if these two linguists these two

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
guys who who live in these similar worlds across this divide. I wonder if they

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.000
know each

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
other they do not know each other as a naive

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
beginner journalist in the region my vision for this story was to do a

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
profile on each guy and then up and get them together and get them in conversation

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
and have them talk about their love for the language when I told people

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000
about this idea. Once I was in Israel and once I was in Gaza.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
People just laughed. It's not possible it's not possible for

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
them to know each other they can talk on the phone they can talk on Skype. But

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
right now it's impossible for. In Sudan to meet

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
face to face.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
So it's not so much. I mean one would have thought that they under quote

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
normal circumstances they probably would know each other I mean they're both

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
leading linguists. But they don't know each other in

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
part you're suggesting because there just isn't any kind of

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
a forum for them to get to know each other for them to even

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
meet. There's no forum for them to me and there are also barriers

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
in place that prevents a gun from traveling into the West Bank or

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Gaza and the who can no longer come in to Israel like he

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
did before two thousand and seven. So yeah there. He cannot come

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
into Israel.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So what about the students what about people in Gaza learning Hebrew

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
people in Israel learning Arabic can they make any kind of contact with each

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
other so and is from the Israelis who learn Arabic have

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
ample opportunities

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
to speak Arabic with native Arabic speakers in fact

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
many Jewish Israelis are native Arabic speakers they come from Arab

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
countries but many Israeli students who study Arabic

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
might be afraid of speaking Arabic because of the stereotypes

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
that exist in that

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
culture for Gazans it's a little bit of a different story there aren't many chances

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
to speak Hebrew with a real live Israeli but one of the great

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
things of course is Facebook a lot of the Hebrew students I spoke with

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
in Gaza said

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
that they have Facebook friends in Israel who they chat with in

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Hebrew and one of the students I spoke with her name is jihad and she's in

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
her

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
forty's and she chats with me in Hebrew She also keeps her cell

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
phone in Hebrew.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
It's sort of like the modern version of pen

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
pals pen pals Facebook. That's all people have. But if there's

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
one person who's really making the most of that side of us. As

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
it's Jihad that student of Hebrew Shayna just mentioned Shana originally met

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
her when she went to Gaza to interview Hebrew students.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
She is very enthusiastic about learning

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Hebrew and when I asked her why she talked about her hair and her skin.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
She said that in Gaza a lot of the cosmetic products the labels are in Hebrew and the

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
ingredients are in

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Hebrew and she said she kept buying shampoo for dry hair and then she

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
would wash her hair and her hair was horrible. It just kept coming out really bad.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
And she was she knew that she was using the wrong type of shampoo for her dry

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
hair and she said she asked the

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
shopkeeper but she knows that the shopkeeper doesn't know Hebrew either so he was just making things

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
up off the top of his head. Now she knows Hebrew and she go shopping and she

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
looks at the labels and when there's a word on the label that she doesn't know she calls her Hebrew

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
teacher Bihu will and ask him to explain

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
it and she says you know we're ladies at the end of the day we're ladies

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
and she wants to buy the appropriate cosmetics for her hair and

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
skin Jehanne this woman during the interview we had to really like a

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
nice connection we laughed a lot. We laughed about the skin

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
products and then. After the interview once I was back in Israel.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
She friended me on Facebook and you know what. Send me like funny like

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
hurt him. Oh geez and smiley faces and these nice messages and Hebrew about how it was so nice

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
to meet me and how like now we're we're friends and I felt like we were really

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
friends and then I clicked on her profile picture and saw that her

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
her cover photo was. Of a Hamas militant launching a custom

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
rocket and I had this like strange reaction of well.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Like what is this and I was living in Israel during the

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
war with Gaza in two thousand and thirteen and experienced running to

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
bomb shelters when there were sirens and

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
so that. Ends of fear has a really powerful

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Reverb for

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
me and then I had this realization of

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
OK it's scary for me

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
to see a picture of someone launching a Kasam rocket.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
But also it's probably scary for people in Gaza to see pictures

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
of Israeli soldiers holding an Israeli flag or walking on the street with her

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
and sixteen

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
and it sort of but meets have this realization

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
that there are a lot of people around the world who

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
throughout history have experienced that same fear and that same

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
threat and that that is what makes the efforts of Buffalo

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
and Sudan.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
So powerful that they are able to overcome this fear

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
and

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
teach language in order to create

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
understanding and relationships also to protect and defend themselves like the

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
idea of defending and protecting your country is not a crime

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
a contradiction to to building human understanding and relationships and that the

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
two can exist

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
together

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
and share

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
the

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
dumb

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
thing

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
from

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
each

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Shayna she spent part of this year in Israel with visits the occupied territories.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
She's studying journalism as well as Arabic in the Middle East at U.C. Berkeley. You can see

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
some of us snapshots of Subby but who are excited and the students

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
at

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
P.R.I. dot org slash language. If you like this well then was hard

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
cause there are plenty more but all the usual places and at those usual places.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
