00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hey

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
there well then work but Nina Pretty be here for a quick mid-week

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
pod cast the news of the Paris and Beirut bombings has been on all of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
our minds and throughout the coverage one word seems to keep popping

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
up by ash. This is the name not ISIS or Eisel or

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Islamic state by DI S. but you may have heard. French President Francois Hollande used

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to describe the quote jihadist army who committed the Paris

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
attack short of saying you don't need yet these big will die to do

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Cuba and for the last year. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has also used

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the word. I

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
asked one thing is certain dosh will continue to spread until or

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
unless it is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
stopped the term is slowly being adopted by international leaders.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
France has actually been a leader on this outside of the Middle East.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This is a book on she writes about Islam and politics and I actually wrote an article for The

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Boston Globe about the term Di ASH a year ago around the time that Kerry adopted

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
the term.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
France has been calling the terrorist that has since last year since then Australia

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
as well has taken up the term as has

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Turkey but more important to me than any of those states is the fact that the people on the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
ground who face a daily brunt of brutality from these terrorists they call them

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that activists on the ground in Syria have been referring to the group that many

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
of us know as ISIS as this term since twenty thirteen and we're going to get more about

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that in the pod cast but now it seems that Western

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
leaders are starting more and more to use the term but the media. It's been all over the place

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in describing what it means and how to pronounce it for that matter

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Arabic translator Alice Guthrie got frustrated with what she's been seeing in the British

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
press there was this one particular phrase that was going around at the time.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
about being a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
nylon that according to how it was conjugated meant different things well you know.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We know is language that nouns don't get conjugate its budget comes again

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to oust really an interesting article dissecting the term for the online website free

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
word and I called her up to talk about it and before we even got into discussing what the term

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
actually means it was a simple clarification of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
what pronunciation.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
First how do you pronounce it correctly.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So it's a dash. It's hard to say because it has the letter I and the letter

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
eyeing which we often write in English using an apostrophe. So when you see those words

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
have an apostrophe in the middle of them on the start of them. That's usually a transliteration of Ein.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Which is also the like if you're saying Arab in Arabic.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It's a add a B.. Yeah if that's answered that's in the middle size that has a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
dash you know I like the way. Well thank you and what exactly if you could

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
just tell me does dash exactly

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
mean it is actually just the acronym of the Islamic

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
State in Iraq in Syria in Arabic those words that phrase in Arabic.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So that in our break is a dollar and Islam in a film and I will

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
show which if you take that as an acronym the Comes dosh.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So actually that's what's strange about it is actually just the Arabic equivalent of

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
saying I said. So I fill

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
ins and so it's just basically the same as saying ISIS or

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
still or I asked what about this particular acronym. Why

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
does Dyess rice or ISIS or I asked dislike this acronym

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.000
so very

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
much that a couple of reasons. First of all you have to understand acronyms and

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
not usually used in Arabic. So you know we're very used to using acronyms in all

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
sorts of ways across and life and culture but that really doesn't happen in Iraq a

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.000
phone linguistic.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So it's like very strange to have a word that's

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
been created a new odd sounding word that's been created so that's that's one

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
reason

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
is that seen as a bad thing having an acronym in kind

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
of taking away

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
power any acronym that was ever created for anything it would necessarily be a bad thing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
but because it's a made up word and you can hear that it's a made up word.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It sounds like a challenge to ISIS's legitimacy as an organization.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
You know it's kind of like you've got a nonsensical made up name for something that implies that it's

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
a nonsensical made up organization

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
or you know phenomena and it's really a dismissal of their aspirations to

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
define Islamic practice and to be seen as a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
state but that's not just because it's an acronym acronym is like one prong of why it's

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
like that the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
other reason the word has such significance is it's like slightly a

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
play on words that sounds quite a lot like that US which is only one letter different with

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
us rather than show the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
end and that means something that's crushing underfoot or trampling

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So it's kind of painfully close to being a description in that way that incidentally is one of

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the things that's caused so much confusion in the media.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Alice actually interview the Syrian activist who coined the

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
term.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
He is an activist originally from rocka which was the first stronghold of ISIS in

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Syria the first city that they occupied and made their headquarters

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
from so obviously I think what's really important in the hall dash narrative as

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
in the words you know when we're talking about the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
word is remember that the activists in Syria with the first and main victims. I mean the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
people of Syria right.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But they were the people who were trying to fire dash from the beginning and still

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
are and so they came up with this term because they really wanted

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
a way to get around referring to them as a state because they don't see them this

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
day an Islamic. I don't see them as Islamic

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and they really fail and I agree that it's very important that the victims choose the name not

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
criminal credit also told Alice that another reason why the name works is that

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
it evokes a dark period in history

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
something about the actual

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
well. That has kind of connotations from

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the Dark Ages it sounds like the words from a generally the age of ignorance

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the prism of

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
timed it really sounds like some kind of monstrous creature. So

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
bursting back out from the depths of time which is in many

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
ways how they see the issue of no wrongdoing band

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
of monsters coming from a different time and place it's hard to believe that

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
people

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
could really think that that's a rational or useful way to act right when we see what they're doing

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
so that's very much the statement that the Syrian activists are making by using this word.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
What about the word evokes that the sound the structure the what about

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that particular word evokes this time period this these monsters this kind

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
of going back into a dark

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
period is just really the sound of it that's what I'm told that has those kind of flowing

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and attentions from the sound and formation of the word.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Khalid final as your head. How do you sort of disseminate this word when they came up with the term.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
How did he disseminate the word and what does he think about the West and the way readers have taken many

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
different forms of calling it isis.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Yeah I asked him that question.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
He said that you know they were absolutely plays that it was going in currency.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
The only thing that I think has been difficult for them and complex for them was when Bashar al

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Assad himself took the term on as an activist working diligently against

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that Syrian dictator they were kind of shocked that

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
they would be even in that kind of level of communication with him I think that Yasin

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
you know him taking on

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that I think it's probably a bit mixed for them saying is nobody. Acknowledging that

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
this word comes from them and I feel a bit sad you know if felt like part of the

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
pattern really of the Syrian activists in the Syrian resistance not being acknowledged and not

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
being celebrated on a global

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
stage with that in mind as well it's not surprising that we don't know

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that the word came from them I was really amazed to find quite across the

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
board in the British press the broad sheet

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
press some kind of weird source some

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
misinformed source had been taken on by all of them. The explanation of what dash meant

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
was with gobbled it made no sense

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
linguistically meaning what it what was garbled there was some understanding of it

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
being an acronym but there was this one particular phrase that was going

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
around at the time

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
about being a narrow

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
one that according to how it was conjugated meant different things well you know

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
we know is language that nouns don't get conjugating verbs conjugated So it

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
was strange and sad to me that this had been recycled regarded it so many

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
times with nobody picking up on

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
that case and different outlets would add their own little flourish. So much is it

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
especially offensive in Lebanon. I mean the chance especially like someone's daydream.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
You know but this could be presented in really quite serious articles and I suspected

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that this would not go on if it was a country that was perceived as closer to home and obviously

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
this kind

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
of dichotomy between van and us is

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
something that's been examined a lot this week you know on social media in the wake of

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
the Paris atrocities. But the rush of silence about the bombings in Beirut that happened

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
at the same time. And so you know I think there's a lot of discomfort

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
around the age old separation of a distant other

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and supposed. Which can sound like kind of very dry theory but I think

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
it's things like the use of this word an interpretation of this word actually

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
meant clay just how much that. I'm going

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
on you wrote in your article said that satire is a crucial weapon in the fight

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
against this group and they wrote that in the satirical Arab media there have been several

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
dim unitive of the word that I saw gone viral and I was curious about what diminutive

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Have you seen that have gone viral in in the Arab

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
world Arabic very similarly to how Spanish

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
does uses diminutives one of the many ways it uses the images is a kind

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
of patronize and belittle my margin from a

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
diminutive So dash. Become a

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
douche which would be like a little dash that is kind of used

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
when referring to somebody who's you know. A little

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
bit of a

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
supporter maybe from afar. And somehow giving them a kind

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
of babyish version of the word is you know just even

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
more dismissive of any kind of claimed.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Well nourished power or potency or anything

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
really there are other examples of. Yes because

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Arabic is.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
As a language is wonderfully structured almost source of algebra.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Language where are the vast majority of Arabic words a made from three consonants

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that we call the

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
root you can sort of pulse on a bit like like different

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
for nations to always have the same kind of meaning.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So what I mean by that is for

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
example our last three letters and

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
now with the filer to do or

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
make but you could then insight into that a certain

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
pattern which would make the

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
subject before and so if you

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
insert and a half a mile.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Would be to the do or the subject the person who does the. Or you could do

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
that same operation to any three week letters means that once

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
you've got this crazy.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Dash is made up well you can do other things because everybody knows the patterns of

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
how you make it into the one that tramples the one that's being trampled or

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
the plural trampoline or whatever it might

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
be once dash has become this

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
one this funny near ledges and everyone finds so funny on the one side

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
or so offensive on the other side you can do other things with it as I

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
was saying Dadu sht the little dash a but also you making

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
plurals acid it making singulars acid and them all this is done the less respectful.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
It seems the more this is done the father you're getting from the

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
name that is chosen by the organization which has

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
the diary formal pompous sounding old classical Arabic and which

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
crucially is a find them as a state which they are not and as Islamic Is there

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
not to further deepen guy with these creative meanderings of this funny

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
silly

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
word the father by guessing from the proper

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
name by abstracting it and turning it into a word. And then playing around with

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
outward it has taken all the power out of this this phrase

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
essentially

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
words were more powerful right like at the end that I we are already talking about

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
naming Yes the satire is really important. Maybe more as

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
a sanity strategy than an actual act of resistance I mean

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
the satire is all very well but we are dealing

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
with something so huge and so serious here that we need more than

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Saturday to stand up

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
