00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
My father is Irish and when he was young he took in

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a great

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
social experiment as an experiment. That's what it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
was it was that Irish

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
language the century all the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
sudden it was in the schools

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and studied it for a very long

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
time but I was about half.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This was in the one nine hundred thirty S. and forty's. It's in

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
pendants country at the time the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:01.000
language

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
people

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
speak the piece. Dating back to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the seventeenth century Irish Catholic spoke Irish the use of the language

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
was discouraged Irish had been ever

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
since in the one nine hundred thirty S. just a decade after independence from

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the Brits the Irish language was

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
back in school.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The question would people speak it. That's actually still the question today.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Another question

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
why

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
psychological resistance to learning the language because

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
their poverty anti modern attitudes

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
anti progress attitude the psychological effort needed to overcome the symbolism.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Today in the podcast Irish language revitalisation the Irish have been at

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it longer than

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
most they were in

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Word is made possible in part by the National Endowment for the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Humanities celebrating fifty

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
years of excellence a bit of history for us Irish is a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Celtic language came

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
from somewhere in Europe. The Romans came across some of these Celtic languages in

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
some form when they arrived in what is today. Gemini

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Austria Belgium northern Spain and elsewhere. We're talking about the fourth to fifth

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
century

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
B.C. we don't know exactly when those languages came first to Britain and then to Ireland but there

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
are certainly well established before the Christian era.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This is Jim McCloskey Jim was born in Ireland he now teaches at the University

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
of California at Santa Cruz.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So a lot of the literature additions and story traditions. You can hear it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
even today's folk tales have their origins in pre Roman gold pre Roman

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Austria and so on.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And by mechanise we don't know fully understand at the point when Christianity came in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
around the fourth fifth century A.D. some remarkable coming together

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
of classical learning and local learning produced a very

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
standardized literary language what we know called

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Irish which made it one of the oldest literary languages in Europe older

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
than English.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
This was a golden age for Irish and it pretty much stayed that way for centuries as

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
the language evolved from old Irish to middle Irish to modern ours

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
invasions by the Normans and then the English and over time other

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
languages French and English established themselves in towns on the coast

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
port towns like Dublin. But until the English really put their foot

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
down Irish was

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
predominant until about sixteen twenty six hundred thirty iron. Is basically

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
a monolingual country whose only language was Irish I was only really with the expansion of

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
English a minister of power beyond the pale beyond

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Dublin that that situation changes so the crucial moment the crucial initial moment

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
in the decline the language comes in the first half of the seventeenth century. Not until

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
then or you mention beyond the pale. I tried that out on a couple of Americans and asked them if

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
they knew where that expression came from very comes from perhaps right comes from.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
You know the pale with an imaginary fence around Dublin that kept the wild Irish

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
at bay and civilization the English speaking civilization was safe inside the pale

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
in the capital

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
city. Yeah. I mean you say the wild Irish was was the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
language associated with this sort of wildness that increasingly

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
from English eyes needed time to

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
absolute

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
hearts of wild Irish or civilized English that live had

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
roof and the trouble for the language was he got caught up in that you might even

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
say it still caught up in that north of the border in northern Ireland which is still of course part of Britain.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But the decline of

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Irish isn't just down to the Brits sure they set it

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
in motion but later on they got a big helping hand from

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
a homegrown

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
group the last steps in the elimination of Irish is a broadly spoken

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
language they were taken by a cooperative and collaborative effort between

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
the colonial government in Dublin and the Catholic Church the single two most

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
powerful institution such shape the life of Ireland in the nineteenth century.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Yes the Catholic Church the very organization

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
that centuries before. I've been the target of Britain's penal

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
laws when the Catholic church thereby But over time it came to

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
an understanding with Island British rulers the church for example

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
ran the schools in Ireland and here is an echo.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The U.S. and its policies toward Native Americans Irish became

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.000
banned in most

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
school to really remove a language from the community have to take a particular step

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
you have to convince the speakers of that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
language that it's a burden rather than a culturally useful tool.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It's only at that point that they will take the extraordinary step of not speaking their native language to their own

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
children any language that is

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
eliminated that's a crucial seven as be taken in a single generation a generation has

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
to come to believe that their language is such a burden that they will not pass I've

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:51.000
broken on to their own children.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The worst reason to learn English the potato famine of the eight

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
hundred forty great famine it wiped out one million are rich

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
people most of them from beyond the pale the West where Irish

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
was widely spoken another million they fled the country in such a

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.000
better

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
life without being so likely that their children would migrate to

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
English speaking countries Britain the US Canada places like that it made

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
sense that they learn English but still Irish

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
families weren't just acquiring English.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
They were turning their backs on

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Irish learning English does not entail. Necessarily abandoning the first language.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Most people the world have always been multi-lingual the vast majority human beings are multilingual have always

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
been

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
multilingual but that means in turn to persuade parents that they will not they will hide their own language

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
from their children you have to work with and within the community.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And so you need leaders within the community who will cooperate in the

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
project. It turned out to be hugely successful before the famine three to

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
four million people spoke Irish as their first language. A few decades

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
later fewer than a million dead Irish was falling off a

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
cliff. Cue the Gaelic revival of the late nineteenth century.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
This was a movement to bring back the native language and culture it soon got taken up by

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
political revolutionaries people who wanted to push the English out of violent and

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
so the Irish language became the symbol not just of the nation but

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
of nationhood and independence.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
In nine hundred sixteen almost exactly one hundred years ago

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Irish revolutionaries staged an uprising in Dublin the Easter Rising it

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
failed in the short time. Most of the leaders were captured and killed but it soon led to

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the end a British rule in all but the six counties that today constitute Northern

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Ireland by nine hundred twenty two The Irish were pretty much running their own affairs.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Which brings us back to my dad in a school room learning the recently

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
liberated language in this newly liberated

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
land said Dad tell me the words that you know an

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Irish. I don't know how to count nine endorsed

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
three How record share shock talk. As one to nine and also

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I remember just a

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
little sad request on when a category one dollar Mark Marcia Holly. What does

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
that mean it means please Miss may leave the

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
room nice but that's it's more than ten years of studying the language.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Some people have fared better with Irish U.C. Santa Cruz is Jim McCloskey For one he grew

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
up in a city a ways away from the Irish speaking areas greatly shrunken

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Irish speaking areas by the time he was at school in the one nine hundred sixty

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
S. but Jim's father wanted him to speak Irish so we sent him to

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
those areas for weeks at a time to learn the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
language and this year I hated his experience it was uncomfortable it was agricultural I was

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
a middle class urban child of the

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
sixty's. But gradually over the years a place in the. Unity and all that

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
has had sort of cast a spell on me and the time I was seventeen or eighteen.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It became a sort of teenage utopia for me representing a kind of freedom than a kind of

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
cultural richness.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Because when you actually get into those communities those ideas being communities you find this wealth of.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Cultural resources songs and music and stories and it's

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
an astonishingly still vibrant

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and culturally exciting community to be

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
even peripherally a part

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
of what kind of people were you staying with what would be the jobs that they would do

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and who would be the other people in the communities who you would

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
meet. This was part of a larger scheme set up at the government. One of the

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
few successful strategies they had which was urban kids like me could go to our speaking

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
areas in the summer. Stay with local families in their farmhouses attend classes during the

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
day and various you know dances

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and musical events in the evening for roughly three weeks every summer and for some people

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
like me that experience turned them into good second language speakers of

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Irish

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It was a strange situation because the people we stayed were for sort of the poor you know they were

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
subsistence farmers or they were agricultural laborers they had virtually nothing.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I remember being twenty

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
boys from various cities staying in this tiny tiny

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
farmhouse three room four

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
months and certain point I began to wonder where the man of the house

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Mickey Hanura nobody who is a wonderful storyteller where where he slept and his brother John slept.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I want to notice that they were going out to the barn to the US House and that's where they

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
slept in the summer to make room for us language learn

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and you know the man I stayed with was a very eminent very well known

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
storyteller.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Only you would tell stories after dinner and this was which

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I enjoyed at the time but it was only later when I went to university to study Celtic studies and

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
archaeology and so on that I came to realise that the stories that he was telling her and

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
the characters had figured in those stories could be traced all the way back to pre Roman

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
gods told and retold and retold and perfected over generations

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
of oral

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
transmission.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So it was an extraordinary experience to be exposed to this ancient and rich

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
culture in that

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.000
time.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
OK so I got to say right now that Jim and everyone else in this part cast that

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
pretty dedicated to Irish but with the exception of my dad.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Everyone else has made a pretty big effort but they're not in the majority

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
most Irish people may be proud of the language but they don't speak it except for

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
a few words. Here's another believer in the language a generation younger than

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Jim His name is Ella O'Halloran and he had a huge advantage in picking

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
up the language.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Both my parents they made a very deliberate decision that we were going to speak Irish in the home.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Illo grew up in the west of Ireland not in an Irish speaking region but very close to

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
work for him and his sister speaking Irish at home and English at school. It worked

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
for a while. But then something a bit unexpected started happening.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
My sister was was speaking a mix of Irish and English in the

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
same sentence and nobody could understand what she was

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
saying so they switch to English at home still there was

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
hope there was school. It was the early one nine hundred ninety S.. And there was still

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
those Irish language classes every day just like my dad had did they help.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Not

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
really the focus of the Irish classes was was not really. Using as

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
a speaking language it was on grammar. It was on language structure and it was

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
also on the Irish language culture so we were studying Irish were studying

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Irish literature as well rather than studying as a speaking language and I think that's

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
why a lot of my

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
generation developed a resentment for the language.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
What was going on Irish Cool's couldn't get it together to teach the national language.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I think it was a determination

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
to not quite indoctrinations but to teach is as much as we could possibly

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
be taught about Irish culture if there was there was an ideological aspect to this.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
What was the ideology. I think it was maybe that kind of one nine hundred thirty S.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
arland we will we will do everything ourselves a little bit isolationist.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
It doesn't seem as though the curriculum a changed all that much since my dad's days more

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
than fifty years

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
before the LS I wish I

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
hadn't improved at school but something in him also resisted the

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
resentment that so many others felt after high school he went to college and go away

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
city which is very close to the Irish speaking region of

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Connemara and he discovered that you could speak the language and talk

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
about contemporary stuff. He started hanging out in Go

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
ways Irish speaking

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
club where they had the chiefest once again it's in the city and just sitting in there and listening

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
to people speak Irish you know it was it was an expectation that you would speak Irish It was

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
just I had greater exposure to your speakers of my own age and so I grade

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
a chance to use this in a more natural flowing conversational manner.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
OK so you then became fluent.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Not quite fluent. I would say that I had a pretty good use of the language certainly a lot

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
better than I do now I was surprised by how

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
much of it was actually kind of stored within me you know how much of it came out

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
when when I wasn't nervous to. To get where you know in a school

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
environment you're focused on getting it right not expressing yourself or I So when I lived

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
in Galway the only requirement was to have a bit of fun and it was it was really there

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
were expressions that I picked up from people who moved into color from kind of Mara that I

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
found hilarious.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I know it's almost impossible to translate humor but I would still like to ask

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
you what was some of those expressions that you found hilarious.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
They're all

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
sexual So Perry my

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
my housemate who is from Karen in kind of Maher come in and

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
say Venus I will crack and which is we were

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
having sex when talking about his night as

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
or or just hearing had the lads from Connemara would describe when they would

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
see like a good looking woman on the street how they would describe it like that.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And I'd kind of be very hesitant to even repeat those things because they could be borderline

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
offensive but it was hearing hearing Ladish banter us qualia as we would say

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
that made me realize that the language could be a bit more than what I thought it

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
was ill mention that. Not speaking the languages much these days he lives in Boston

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
now he's been based in the US on and off the ten years.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
One of the first things I did when I moved to Boston was I found an Irish speakers club and they do

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
exist a good friend of mine from my hometown teaches Irish in Boston.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
So I would say that there's even now in Boston there's a

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
stronger fire speaking community than there was five or six years ago and it's more US

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
focused and here's something Irish really has going for it the support of

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
the D.S.P. or the Irish abroad and of course it's especially strong here in

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
the US what people who call themselves Irish maybe Irish born

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
like Ala or maybe a generation or two

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
or five or six removed only

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
a fraction of them learn Irish but

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
still and well if you think health

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and. I think one of

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
S.S. Now I don't know what those two people are saying either but they are speaking

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Irish. Hello it's mission on and that means.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Hi my name's come on ten year old Connell Baba his father's called

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Gault I was born in clientele California. My father also

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
was born in California and his grandfather though was born in Wyoming or

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.000
something like

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
that Galt came to the language through traditional Irish

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:36.000
music which father and son play together.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
OK Yes we're talking about a tiny number of people like Bob the family but it

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
shows how much goodwill there is here in the U.S. for all things

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Irish there's also academic support. There are dozens of places here is

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
a college's old language club so what have you when you can learn Irish.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
At U.C. Santa Cruz where

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Jim Acosta is a linguistics professor. What does also a research project.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Focused on Irish pronunciation which if you've ever attempted it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Well you know that you can use any help that you can get this is where Jay

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Padgett comes

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
in talking it's like this amazing orchestration of different things happening in order

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
to produce speech and so if you want to study that you have to see

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
it see it see pronunciation in this case see

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
how Irish speakers produce consonance Irish consulates are categorized as

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
either slender or

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
broad when I said below that slender B. and when I say

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
boy that's a broad

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
B. to C. the gymnastics involved in producing these sounds

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Jayhawks speakers up to a helmet like head vice. It's kind of creepy.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
So this thing looks like something from one of the song movies when we whip it out this is the scariest

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
moments and I

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
research the helmet is equipped with a camera. Hey presto. The researchers

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
get ultrasound. Images of people emitting sounds.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000
They're working with a linguistics professor in Ireland at University College Dublin her name.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Boy am I glad she introduced herself.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Not that I mean it's challenging for non our speakers at times it takes a little bit

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
of training you notice if there are signs that you are not used to

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.000
pronounce

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
and the research itself could be invaluable and not just to students and teachers

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
of ours. It's a snapshot of the language

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
today we want the days of the week collect to be usable

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
as a kind of a benchmark really so how's the language

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
changing how the language is

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
changing from another

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
perspective how it should change or maybe

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
even should know. There's a whole lot of should when it comes to

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
our Should the language

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
expand to include the version of Irish for some younger Dublin and speak

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
people for from the Irish speaking regions. These are people who grew up speaking

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
English but to a greater or lesser extent have embraced Arash on

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
their terms it's their own Irish

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
one that ignores classic pronunciation or certain aspects of the

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
grammar an Irish that sometimes mixes in some English words

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
should the language allow for that of keeping the

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
nation building flame

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
alive is for

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Ireland has suffered so many betrayals over the years

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
who may be doing the betraying

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Now again there are echoes of Native

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
American languages and their

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
struggles and this is why there are a language purists in Ireland

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
some in powerful positions overseeing policy. Don't mess

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
with the language. It's the subtext of their message.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
It defines us as a people. We brought it back after independence in

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
one hundred twenty two you may not like the way we taught it and dressed it up

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
in a narrative about what it is to be Irish You may call

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
the effort

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
a failure because you didn't remember the words you learnt at

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
school but it gave you a sense of

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000
being

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
still living languages change. That's what they do and if they don't.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
It's a good indication that dying.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
According to the most recent census in two thousand and eleven seventy seven thousand

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
people in Ireland speak Irish on a daily basis. Not counting students who only

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
speak at school seventy seven thousand going to disappear

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
tomorrow. But that same census also found one

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
hundred nineteen thousand people in Ireland speak polish on a

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
daily basis.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
So what's the way forward for

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Irish is in other countries which one might look at this whole effort not in the context of the

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
the global issue of language loss and the loss of linguistic diversity

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
went back with Jim McCloskey of U.C. Santa Cruz and in that larger

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
context in a fundamentally sort of anti nationalist perspective on the

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
issue. It doesn't matter much but this new language doesn't much resemble

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
traditional owners at all the fact is it's a new linguistic variety is being used

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
for interesting creative purposes and interesting community

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
purposes and it is thereby increasing the store of linguistic and

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
cultural diversity in the world and if your goal in quote unquote

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
preserving Irish is to increase the store of linguistic and cultural diversity in the world today.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Then one has to say that this has been the partial success because

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
that community of second language speakers would not have existed. If that project had not been

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
initiated in one thousand twenty

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
two. Paunch we've been

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
