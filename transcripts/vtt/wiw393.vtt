polyglot and as it turns out pod cast. Listener.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Eddie Izzard is the subject of our podcast today and just to warn you there will be

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
some explicit language in this pop cast. So if you're listening with the kiddos.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now's a good time to put in your ear

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
buds Eddie Izzard stand up is full of bits

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
about

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
language but everything that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
could do that act with dogs I don't think I'm a doctor I'm faster than anyone ever

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
had and the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
rebels did all this with a language that we know from school is

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
silly silly billy

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
language has a knowledge of a bucket of accusative a genitive a date of an

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
aberrated Fox

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000
all.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But back in the late ninety's. It wasn't enough just to joke about language and he wanted to joke.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In other languages and he joked about that too. I mean how hard is

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
it really to learn another

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
language and one thing about speaking language is not rocket science you don't have to invent the fucking one.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That just there you go to look at it and. I got it I want to go and then look it up you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
don't have to say well how do we come up with a word for a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
cow about how we're going to kill the cat thing you know it's already there.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Just got to learn in different languages

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so it's just that easy but perhaps for Eddie

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
it is. He started doing stand up in French in one thousand nine hundred seven and over

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
nearly two decades he's gone on to do stand up in German and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Spanish language learning for him is all about confidence. That's at

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
least what he told me when I spoke with him he had a lot to say about it and a lot to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
say very quickly I might

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
add

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I came into comedy is like I'm greedy this is if you want to be a great deal you know. Yeah

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I don't need questions as long as we get a language we're going to talk language like yeah you know. So with

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
English speakers particular things and then with every other

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
speaker that they might be able to speak a certain language to a certain level but their confidence their

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
ability might be. Say sixty percent and their confidence

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
down thirty or twenty percent anyone going to second language third language they have a confidence

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
level my confidence level in German my billet is about forty. I'm about forty percent fluent

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I estimate. My first of a French cake I lost all my ability to talk to him or his well I was just

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
breaking I was breaking through

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
English is awful and I didn't know how to do

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
it

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
was I have an ear that's got a book

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to talk as you know I'm lazy other English people

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
here now call C.C.'s the.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Basket Well I just said I'm going to talk to both languages OK and then everyone can be fucked up.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Google it by pissed off. You could piss off.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
You'll see me stand on the stage with what looks like a bible of. In my head it is

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the translation of the entire

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
show verbiage like you translate it word for word until I gave it to someone to one transcribe

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and then to someone else to translate it and then I got it and I will it last and it on

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the record throw it down that they are. Now under the noise

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
of the red haired big brown you know big heavy.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I like war and peace of a thing and I said I'm not learning that I'm just not going to sit there and learn that page by page.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I decided having someone work very hard on it that I would just. I would sort

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.000
of wing

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
it you want to watch I think they've got I'm a good guy but

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I just mean you know the number of

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
your posts. But that

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
may just say that's good news.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
We'll hear a bit. But in the end.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I've worked out now our complete system how to do things with my brother Mark is out is the language actually

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
speaks French German Spanish pretty fluently. While he's done a year of Russian now so Russians the next one

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
after Spanish I have to get Spanish

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
first and then we go for Arabic we were both born in Yemen so yeah you were born in

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the colony of Aden should say Odan audible are hardened because.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Yeah we are now I'm hearing my dream is to go back to Adam and do a gig as a civil war

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and yeah Cairo is where we're going to go

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to and that is the place everyone says get to Cairo. You gotta learn Egyptian army because they do all because

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the dialects are quite different and.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
GYPTIAN Arabic everyone seems to understand that which I think similar to in

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Scandinavia where the Danish and the Norwegians understand Swedish but not the other way round. Probably

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
because of a lot more television is ten million population in Sweden and

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
five in roughly five in going to war against an Arabic than Egyptian Eric St I want

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
to swear I want

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
the like in French ability said. Which is

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the F. word is the F. bomb as you call it in America in France.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
mean prostitute or I suppose whole social. Oh horse to the horse seller

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
English colonel and in the right old horse everywhere.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Well anyway I said this perfectly. I got the hang of

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
this because you think it would be mailed. Yeah yeah exactly but it isn't exactly.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And they do so whenever a song gets really angry and I said it playing in

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Paris and that's how my stuff got. And these French guys just looked at me and I

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
thought wow they're looking at me with that look of he swears like. That is arriving that

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
is wearing like a like a front Yes well like a native So

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
you're you have a successful career in English you're doing you know huge arenas was like What

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
made you decide to do that first French show and then do German and then do Spanish and how many are you doing

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
now and how many languages.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's now I've started my fourth I

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
started Spanish in a better way than one week in Madrid but I do

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
know the technique now we've got this extreme technique which is I my

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
brother translates the entire show. Line for line we've got the lines into a very

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
good second as a loose with the lines of I've changed a lot of the

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
time but I made it with my brother saying that line

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that that line to that line to that i'm he translated the lines and he put it

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
into good French but not brilliant French. So the equivalent

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
of English where you say I went down the road I went to have a cup of tea rather than I promenaded

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
down the the route and thought about

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
some some vittles for myself you know you're not putting in those words which you know

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
spoken

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
language. Yes spoken language real decent spoken language which is better than my

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
this is the way think people come and see me see the show in French and they see

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
me deliver you know a really good spoken French show and then they come up in object with

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
me go. Who doesn't speak that

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
well you're going to start some fuckin time learning French. What are you doing if you don't speak French of X.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
X. X. So I'm going to try you know if you do get pissed off then just

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
storm out of the army. And that's why i'm not been apologizing. You

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
know apologized

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but that's OK.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Oh then there's a call by the well

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I know about seventy five percent drop did you learn in

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
school like where did you pick yesterday years there he is there but everything has been after that

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
my radical ideas.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
School is good but there's nothing to compare with being in the country deep emotion is the

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
way emotion is the key thing and I say that one month in

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the land is equivalent to two years of training in the

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
school something like

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that I feel like it's impossible to learn another language actually without being like fully immerse I mean you

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
know I there are other people that are like amazing at language learning. You know you hate you we hate

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
you how do you do it so well you seem to be one of those but you know no

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I don't my motion. I did on the last German show a German show had done two years of school seventy six to

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
seventy eight only that got

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
to either be in German in two years or so that was pretty good and I went

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
back in

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
twenty fourteen. I think it was fourth Anyway I did two months

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that they have a normative General Jones of accusative dative and

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
genitive therefore

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
declensions I decided I will not learn those I will not go back and relearn them and apply

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
them to everything to be different for each word I'm just going to guess them and even them

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
asking for evidence and using the gas and I'll let the intelligent German people

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
work out where I'm going wrong and just twist in their heads so I get

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
it right the sound and the gate

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
crashing which you quit

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
smoking shall still suffice if you get

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
the Eddie

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Izzard's comedy is more like a one man show. Yes it feels loose and

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
conversational but it's actually pretty highly were Hearst. And in fact a lot of the shows have these That's

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
an elaborate. Entrances even appears out of a book in one of his earlier shows definite article.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So translating his one man show into other

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
languages seems to have worked out pretty well I read a view of the that

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
your German show that said quote During force majeure is it gets to grips with.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
German sentence structure and declensions earning knowing applause from the Berlin crowd for

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
his perfect use of the fiendishly tricky genitive case at one

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
stage I want that's my that's not great. That's a salute to my brother but sometimes I would ad

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
lib and get it right the genitive but the would

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
do just because I'd love to ask a cite that I was could cite in

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
it but I love anything that means excellent and it's you have to go that TS It's that in

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
the psych unit. So I spent ages saying and I also the web. I'd swear

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
the middle of

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
it because it means X. and I'd say X.. I want to say fucking excellent but to act out

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
fucking Zagnut baby. We've got to do this is fantastic because I think the you're that

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
do is have these in here in belly and ache with an angle and I've told

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
you that is one of the boxes ask a fucking Zeisler

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
baby. And these are the peony you're the pioneers all orders are

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
to come I tell him the pioneers because they're there watching it. Choosing to go out if one

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
says there's a different sense of humor Yeah I was going to

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that's not true and ot true. The references the different

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
American references will trip up an American comedian when playing abroad because

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
if he says and then I hit him with her she's back.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So the net of what's funny is is the same all over the world too much of human

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
is humor is universal you find though the Germans the French or the

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Spanish laugh at different places and

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
know exactly the same places I have a line that I can I can go through. Three

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
languages Caesar. Did you ever think I have towards these I think sees it did you ever think you'd end up

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
as a salad.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
People earning the same time or yes this is how we go and in French says a

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
jammy imagine a. Imagine unusual if you near a on they had finished

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
up or sell out its Shepherd's salad and in German you got the verb at the end of the sentence

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
you really think this would throw it or because they put this verb at the end where he goes says I had a a

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
good actor the everything that I now that he won time outs the lot and then

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Villa as solid and that would help.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And still they laugh in exactly the same place. Guaranteed time for time maybe not

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
mainstream audiences may I did play to a mainstream audience in London who didn't get what I was talking

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
about was interesting yet

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
so all you've got to do is have your references universal or explain

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
your references.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So if you want to talk about her she's which is really not known outside America that we wear Kit Kats are. You can hit some of

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
the character I accepted but if you said the other thing to her she's by this guy got

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
her she's made it and there it is and I never remember I know they

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
exist and then once you've explained. You can talk about it in your comedy the door of our joint

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
whole show about if you want because people know what it is it's a chocolate that are you know Charlie.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Yeah well you know. Has that mean that universal aspect have or learning all these languages has

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
it changed the way you approach comedy

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
has yes I've dumped all puns or are jokes

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
about saying it with sayings included and

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
all very British references. Even when you're doing English Oh yeah

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
because I'm too lazy to change I mean I'm a hard working lazy person.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So the idea that I have a whole set that I do in Britain the whole you know

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
to twenty eight countries a place now. You never get in Moscow to kids in Moscow going to kids and some Petersburg in

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Istanbul in Berlin and I appeal to American

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
comedians get out there go for it do it play around the world needs now plain English

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
or just don't do this for all the different languages. OK but assume the

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
intelligence of the people you're talking to and they will they will work with you if you're making the effort.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
There is nothing more humbling like then being in a in a language that you do not speak and learning how to communicate

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and realizing that you can

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
communicate where you can you can get. I'd say catalyst off of the conversation not

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
sure but you become like

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
a big home like a child with you know your communication levels run down the children said the

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
beautiful thing a build up in French and the next show I'm planning

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to which I'm hoping to give a Russian name to

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Lulu to the Russians. I want to start in

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
France and develop it on the stage and so they call it a whole day

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
so we got work in progress do that on the stage so I will actually be adlibbing stuff as I don't

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
write anything in French letter in French and that will take my French to another level in the first

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
two weeks of that will be

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
horrendous that first time that you stood on stage and you did stand up in French were

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
you terrified I mean was it.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
If you don't it's documented. I went backstage and I said that I just

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
said talk about a hundred times because they've actually been set up on ASP a very closed room

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
invited

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
audience just maybe it was it was an invited audience but it was a stage with an

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
open bar to share with anyone else in the area who wanted to come and drink a big hall

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
she shaping it

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
was it was so such a wrong place to

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
be I panicked about that and then after our country lose and that's because even if I just

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
stand up there that'll be the brave funniest bravest Yeah it wasn't funny. It was not from their

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
ass people afterwards and all the bilingual

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
people know it well and it was and I know I was there. It was I was just

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
sweating with struggling I couldn't get out but I did it

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
how long before you felt funny in French.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
First I didn't ninety seven in ninety I did a week or so of I

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
would

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
guess I would guess about for three or

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
four gigs into that those first six gigs. I would've started to fall of some of this

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
is landing in two thousand I did two

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
weeks and the second week felt

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
OK so most of you know that a lot.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Also saw that it created you know so much.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Cock to really do the social stupid they go and do this

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
or that but you

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
didn't think what he

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
was name as didn't go.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But the boys. I did a story but it didn't work if

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
it was never a point I thought that it wouldn't work with the English or because this is a thing in Britain we say which

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
other if you say in America is the French of the visual sense we just say that one line

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
all sixty million them they just have a visual

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
sense you have that you might not know you have the Germans have

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.000
no

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
sense of humor and we got that one I must bear World War two Well one thing but the truth

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
is there are some Republicans in America who knows and see what people ought to know so human that you

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
know there's a lot of people in Britain. You know since you know every country you can find all the

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
no sense of you the people there are some sense of humor people and then there are a strong sense of humor

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
people and then there's

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
also so real that you're political who prefer this prefer that for observational there are

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
no nationalities that own all the fun he wants

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
is yeah it's like jazz jazz is an

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
American built style of music but if a brilliant jazz

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
saxophonist was born in China that great jazz player that

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Chinese caters you wouldn't go now you're not allowed to now it's an American thing you. Chinese

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
have a this sense of music or that sense of music the sense of music is rock'n'roll came out of America but

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
then the Beatles also well Actually anyone can do it if you want to do it

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
it's just the sensibility of just the style of

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
music. It sounds terrifying I mean I guess doing comedy in general

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
stand up is terrifying and then I think. Taking it in putting in another language terrifying.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Well there's an equivalent of driving. Everyone does it and we went

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
through that terrifying period stand up to the question of saying here's a comma OK that's the

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
clutch control OK you can put. Steel is going to be a biting

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
point. You can use to get shift going these are looking to merit. Check just

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
driving traffic that's what we

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
do is it terrifying though to get to white when you're in a car and suddenly like not thinking about driving

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
so much the point you get no accident because you totally get taken for granted like Tommy does the same

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
way when I don't think that happens I think people think it's over good but they get really a tune with

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
it actually you know DRIVER three as have as big John think I can remember while going. I think everyone goes to that place

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
but doesn't the same mean that unsafe.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I have been driving along having a chat and suddenly come into my my emergency what you're

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
looking at looking at the decades when you're driving that old driving comes and what you experience you're

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
just looking at Verity tried hiding in Boston

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
God yeah we'll try driving London Paris. Paris Grammy out the trail if you have

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
seven lines and the rules and this and the rule the lines are not mocked. Well they call

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
people masterful here. Probably not a dry.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Well it's all retarded All right so you know I

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:08.000
think

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I may find traffic.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Universally hated. Although ultimately driving is not that terrifying

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
anymore after many years of doing

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
it I still am terrified at the thought of standing on

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
stage in front of thousands of people and being funny and then to be funny

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
in another language. Forget it but Eddie Izzard he just doesn't seem to have fear but

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
you posted to me that it all just has to do with

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
this system that he's developed to reform in a different language.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I can learn three minutes a day of a show like memorization. Yes memorize like

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
a play happens because I chose well that place is

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
not so alien to me was when I became either Michael really can do that anyway so I learned it like

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
a play. So I'll show should take me twenty days of intensive what would

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
probably means. Which is three weeks project four weeks to because your brain tends

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
to overheat I mean it really is just sitting bang into your head and then the night when you do it a lot of fall

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
out of your head.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Have you had a moment on stage or a like are like well you know not

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
a lot will hire not have I have someone in the wings. With the script. Oh my brother and I

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
say in German that's better or it's what you say and British that or you say line please.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
You just say line and they go. Does the my lot I mean yes yes OK.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Does the My lord I mean use carry on and the audience will just go OK they screwed up there but they

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
got the line and were on.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I mean doesn't matter. Instead of so much I just says that's

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
better but the point is once of that then I learn the language that's the weird thing I'm going to learn

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
to play first because once the play's up and running I can do the gigs I can go out there and then

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I can learn how to speak the language but I feel like

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
your secret weapon is your brother he's a very good secret weapon to have he has a sense of

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
humor and suddenly realize he's the perfect person to what was a language consultant my

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
brother's

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
really strong on grammar and loves being precise with grammar. Whereas me and my manager.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Helen were both communicators first and grammar second. And that's an easy place to

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
go over if you communicate first and you get your grammar right second then you will plow on

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
and I always thought that there's two kinds of people the people that are like unafraid of just black and

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
white thing whatever they were you know just going for it not caring about getting it wrong and I'm OK

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
for those people right communication first like you but I'm always I'm the opposite I'm like I can

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
understand everything that's going on I can understand it all but if I'm saying it I'm just terrified

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
of like X..

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
It's how much you can smash the humiliation my gift to myself accidently coming out as

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
transgender thirty years

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
ago when I walked out the door in one thousand nine hundred five in heels and makeup.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
There was so much humiliation coming my way I was just trying to

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
keep you know just trying to go around town and

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
be exist and people would turn to you and point. Look whisper

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
shout scream abuse whatever it was the. Levels of

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
that but being able to go through that humiliation and it got better and now I don't give a monkeys in

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
that you know when he shouts anything. And in Britain people know me so it's kind of positive as

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
in front so I'm not on there and I have had the negative things but I will go and confront the negative things

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
and the have no fear. Basically you've got

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I'm taking my fear level way down but I still sense fear but I

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
don't but I might it consuming and it's weird Actually I don't if it's necessary a good thing but

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
when I when I feel I've been salted I will turn around and go back out and go

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
and stand next to them or confront.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Yeah it's your fight I'm not a fighter. Well yeah you know I want to be in Special Forces when I was a kid.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Seriously I was going to be a paratrooper Marines and then go Special Forces S.A.'s is what they have in

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
our country and that was my that was a serious considered plan and off of the cadet ship you do

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
three is they pay for your university and you go off. I don't know whether I would have got into them.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Well what happened why didn't you go that

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
path because I also wanted to act as also

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
being transgender that I did that fit in and also which war with they said you have

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
to I don't know what it was a very clear war. The other one's been less clear.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
You know and so I thought OK this moment of ability in this I get I'm going to leave that in a bag and

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I'm not I'm just going

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
to go for the creative side of me but my career is run on military lines.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
So you can you know this is tricky being transgender

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
and being able to play roles like in

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Hannibal and Treasure Island and stuff and then tour the world like the Hollywood Bowl Madison Square

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Garden tour in four languages. What's tricky about it what it what do you mean.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Well if you list all the people who've done it you notice it's a little tricky because it's not a truck

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
rather people have done it because it's tricky to put together they won't let you play if you're

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
transgender and they won't let you play certain old boy roles anymore. Like a

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
boy or a moden girl now you know and if I'm and I've been trying to do this thing if I

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
can still play boy because a lot of boys. I think so me and then this go Jim I think so

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
because there's both genetics I mean I thought I'll just keep playing both things

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
and and that's a little tricky to pull off

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
because it's not truck with not a whole thing of hey it's that old transgender thing with tons of people doing

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
that they were given some of these old some of those old like to do whatever you want to go you

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
know

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
I was going to be in the army when I was a kid. Yeah I don't say that people go you know I was

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
going to be the enemy when I was gay because because if you're trying to bust out you're actually a male told Boy that's where

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
the sexuality

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
is yeah it's not it's not drag race now gay men have got that covered

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
and this is a male tomboy and people do get mixed up and put transvestite

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
the nude little bit of a crowbar separation thank

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
you I'm gay man I think would agree. And it's male lesbian.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
That's really write it because it's true

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
because most concepts like fancy go on to women so that's where they are so

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
running jumping climbing trees putting on makeup when you're on that down

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
versus

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
some ideas on the I mean as you might know this is not much Mike of an

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Emmy is that they only have an icon look and that's a bit slapdash

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:26.000
geneticist

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.000
and I look a

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
mess. So you conjoin they go No no you're wrong right of

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
let's say on the right. And they're missing issues your opportunity here because we

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
all know one of the main elements of attack is the element of surprise.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.000
So

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
what could be most

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
surprising than the first Battalion transvestite

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
brigade

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Bomb Wing the ABOL one wing power shooting into dangerous areas with

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
fantastic Michael.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
They're posing forces going fuck about we're going to

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
god that god god god

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
god says

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
we're going

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
for three of us are such

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
a prize risk for

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
the show

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:27.000
yet

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
the thing is languages company that's hogs some of them a Honda but they're not fond of

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
it because old mandarin Chinese kids big man or Chinese or Russian kids be rational our kids speak Arabic.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
You know you never get a country saying these kids didn't matter managed to get the language so they just

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
sit in the cone and point to things.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
It is that hurdle of humiliation I think

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
that's yeah the guy that had the cumulation that is the thing that I have given myself accidentally

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
by realizing I was transgender coming up thirty years ago that I worked

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
out what it is to work for human ation I can I can add things on to what

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
I do and go through the

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
early part of the humiliation when people say you're an idiot for doing that and what you're

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
doing is rubbish and we hate you for a lot of the I can walk through

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
that well. Eddie Izzard thank you so much for stopping by and talking with me

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
thanks for

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
the earth

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
and the language did you speak and I think that this is

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
the language has become the lingua franca whatever the fuck that means around the world. It's taken.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Because on this basic level isn't terribly simple. You know we have apples and apples.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
I want to laugh so I'm going to give you an apple that. Apple came to me I said your apple of the Apple two the apple by the apple books is just like

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
an

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Apple Apple. And it was apple or happily does Apple offers a

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
bump someone one of us years ago a bunch and got to get out of

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
the well but clever levels got no mask this. It's nice to know that we don't usually ask.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.000
It's a bug

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
and Apple's going

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
to be sound work

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
sound works from

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
P.R.I. it snowed over the weekend or not gotten I'm slurs about
