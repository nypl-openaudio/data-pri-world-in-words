00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The world in words is made possible on top of the National Endowment for the

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Humanities celebrating fifty years of excellence.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Tim Smart is a bridge. He lives in middle England really right in

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the middle of England

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
nearly It's a small town called Dunstable it's got a main street or a high street.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
As it's called that full of those little stores that used to exist in Main Street America.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Tim owns one of those stores and just in case you're thinking this sounds a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
little too twee and old fashioned I should say the name of the store

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is Secrets. It's an adult entertainment

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
store twenty two

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
years an eternity. Now back in the old days about fifteen years ago

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
things were pretty stable pretty

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
serene more recently the shops on the street and the street itself.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's changed the whole area has over the last three four five years something like

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that what's changed. Tim says it's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
foreigners

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
foreigners have come to live in Dunstable from all sorts of countries like Turkey.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We would have to question the town. We just had in a Turkish restaurant I'm

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
fantastic let's be fair we will have a problem food meeting but

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in my case. And of course along with the restaurants and their foreign owners have come

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
their families families of foreigners a lot of the families are obviously

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
speaking tonight is tongue. Tim knows that these foreigners the kids especially he

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
knows that they pose an economic threat to the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
locals if they will who might be in the native tongue and then you're into an English school year in

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
English if they then apply for a job for any supermarket or any position

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
anywhere who would usually somebody speaks to language was someone who speaks one

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
language in case you didn't catch that Tim is asking rhetorically he's asking

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
whether the children of low. Foreigners who've been schooled in English and so

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
now speak two languages. He's asking now he's suggesting

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that they are more

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
employable than monolingual Brits. And for Tim This hits

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
close to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
home but deuce is just a ploy for a job with a safe look at Mitchell

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
names so Tim's daughter speaker of English only finds herself at a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
disadvantage losing out to a bilingual

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
foreigner and in Tim's mind this is because the British government has an open door

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
policy when it comes to foreigners settling in Britain and being told

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
English is not a level playing field demoralise Tim's right. It isn't a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
level playing field. If you speak more than one language.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You may well have an economic edge. His solution is to pull the country out of the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
European Union and stop the free flow of people across European

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
borders. It's not quite the same here in the U.S. but there are parallels. There's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
plenty of anger the way letting too many foreigners in and then

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.000
educating their

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
children at taxpayers' expense and that one day. That'll come back to bite us.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
That's certainly what tym things in his small Middle English town. He just sees

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
it through the prism of language. If you stop immigrants from coming. You can

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
keep the country monolingual and that way no one will have

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to buy

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
language

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is this

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
some fringe opinion. Maybe maybe not. We'll find out

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
more of the Brits vote this June on whether to leave the E.U. a British exit

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
a Breck's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
it. Many of those who want to leave say it's because they want to regain

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
quote control of immigration. Maybe regain control of good

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
old British monolingualism to.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Today we're going to a few places where people are taking very different tones places

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
where people a working. Bilingual ledge Hawaii the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Netherlands as the two of them. The third is closer to

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
home now language acquisition whether it's for monolingual multilingual speakers.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It's something we're understanding more and more about seems like every few months.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
There's a new study out on this. Here's a recent

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
one baby talk patens give a clue into early language

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
acquisition children use previous vocabulary

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
to help learn new words that's the headline and the kids in that study they were

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
all of two years old I can beat that Patrick. This is Ari Daniel He's a

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
reporter with the big show aka the world public radio program and also the public T.V.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
show Nova. And yes it's true. Ari can be

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
me I can go much younger. He's talking here about studies of language

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
acquisition it actually starts way or earlier than we ever thought and

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
researchers are learning more by looking not just at the sounds we make but at a language

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
is rhythm and pitch is well you ready. Go for it. OK

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So Patrick I want you to go back to when you were a kid

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and listen to

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
this

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
know everybody needs a good day.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Yes I recognize I think American listeners will too because this is

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
an Australian sun right. You know neighbor. Yes it played in

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the United Kingdom. I don't I don't think it ever played over here right.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Not one of my favorites I have to

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
say Joe

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
resoldered

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
where in the late eighty's a British psychologist published a

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
study showing that pregnant moms who watch Neighbors every day gave birth

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
to babies who reacted more strongly to the theme song than those whose moms didn't

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.000
watch the

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
show that the first paper which has shown that fetuses can be exposed.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Two specific type of signs and then elicit some sort of reaction to them after they have been

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
born a no part and is a Finnish neuroscientist at or whose University

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Hospital in

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Denmark pardon and wasn't involved in the soap opera study but it's inspired a bunch of

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
his work including a cool thing he and his colleagues tried a few years ago while in Finland.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
They took a group of pregnant moms and for fifteen minutes a day five days a week during

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
their last trimester. He asked them to play this loud but up up

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
up up up up up up. Wow. It doesn't sound like a Finnish music hit.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And there are sadly even some things that would be annoying. How do you find moms that want to do

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that through friends and relatives who don't

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
have to say no.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Mostly plus through internet discussion boards and occasionally in the recording the

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
middle syllable of the Ta ta sequence would be swapped out for a different

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
vowel thought that that thought up up up up up up up up.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Really are is is there a difference that.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Yeah. It goes. Tut tut tut tut toto a listen one more

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
time thought that that thought up. OK I hear that but it's

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
really thoughtful just just the middle settle right.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Right and pardon and did one other thing with the middle syllable. Sometimes he changed its

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
pitch but up up up up up up up up up up up and then just days

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
after they were born Parton played the stimuli to the newborns and used in the IGI

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
to monitor their brain activity. He compared it to a group of newborns who didn't receive

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the in utero Ta-Ta stimulation.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The results couldn't be clearer both groups of babies responded identically to

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the sequence with the different vowel.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But that up brought up because that second vowels heard all the time in finish. You don't

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
need a special recording to be exposed to it as a fetus. But only the

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
babies who had been exposed in utero to the pitch change but that

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the. But UP UP UP UP UP UP UP UP recognize it once they're

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
born and that's because just as an English pitch isn't relevant in Finnish compared

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
to some languages Chinese for example where words take on different meanings based

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.000
on

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
pitch. So babies that don't hear different pitches in utero don't respond to them

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
later or more simply babies respond to the signals they first hear in utero.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And of course these signals can come from one language or many

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
languages the way I think of the early development is the female fades build

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
up specific predisposition to the what we are going to experience later on

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
after being born babies on a born as a blank

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
slate rather a kind of groundwork. Gets laid in utero that

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
familiarizes us with the world we're about to encounter and if that world has more than one language.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
We also prep for that in

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
utero a lot of language crosses to uterine wall and so the by the time with babies

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
foreign they're not an inexperienced listener.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Janet Werker is a developmental psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
It's a very multi-lingual city. We have babies growing up in all sorts

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
of combinations of

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
languages including bilingual homes where English and Filipino are spoken two

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
languages with different spoken rhythms and worker wanted to know whether

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
babies exposed to English and Filipino in utero are familiar with both languages

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
at

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
birth and whether they can differentiate between them. She and her colleagues work with newborn

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
several hours to several days old. Granted it's a tricky population.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
They don't talk yet and they don't point they don't follow

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
instructions so she wired a pressure sensor up to a

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
pacifier babies will change their rate of sucking their strength

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
of sucking and you can condition the sucking

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
reflex which is to say that how much a baby sucks. Or how strongly that baby

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
socks can tell you how familiar and interesting something is to the baby like these.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Awful speech samples that worker played filter to sound like they would in the

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
womb. This is

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
English

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and this is

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Filipino the results from

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the moment a newborn baby is

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
born who is growing up in a bilingual environment they listen.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Preferentially to speakers of either of the languages they heard in utero. And

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
they're able to track the rhythmical properties of each so they're born

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
ready to learn to mind witches and not confuse

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the worker says all this learning before birth might be useful. First it may

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
allow babies to identify who is part of their community once they're

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
born and second just from rhythm cues babies may be able to track how

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
certain words function and give them a head start on learning that language. All

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
this might come in handy when considering early interventions for things like dyslexia.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
These are still

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
hypotheses so worker appreciates a more concrete and intimate lesson one

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
she's learned by watching the parents watching their babies in an experiment like

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
this it communicates to the parent that their baby is interested in the world

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
around them and is interested in learning from the first moments of

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
life and we like to think that this might make them treat their baby as

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
this curious involved little being that they

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
are OK I get it. Newborns. They may seem kind of

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
unformed they can't do very much but then be full of there's a ton going

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
on and even before that even before they're born language is such

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
an irresistible force to us it finds its way into the womb

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and it makes connections not just in the baby's brain but also between

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
the baby inside and the world outside.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Yeah and then in one or several languages right. And whether. One or more

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
appears to really

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
affect how the brain functions. Yes OK Ari. So my kids who

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
you've met and played charades you know it's a good time she's bilingual English and

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Chinese should I know would myself a gold star for that does she

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
have what some people call the bilingual

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
edge. You know I asked Janet Werker about this in particular

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and you know I said Does raising a kid in a bilingual environment give

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
that kid some advantage and she said that yes there are certain advantages like in

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
the realm of what's called executive function the ability to switch between different

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
tasks but on the other hand. Janet Werker told me that

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
often a bilingual kid will have a smaller vocabulary in each language than

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
a monolingual kid. Unless the bilingual kid is a really avid reader and then they can kind of make

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
up for

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
it so there are differences growing up monolingual versus bilingual It's not like

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
one is better than the

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
other the key is that babies adapt to the language environment that they're

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
in when they're born and even before so doing well in the world really

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
starts with doing well in the

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
womb already done you. He's a science reporter here in Boston he works at the big

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
show and Nova the public T.V. science show he is also hands down

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
the world's best rights play. This being a pole cause to know you just have to trust me on

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
that well Nina politically and me. We've been thinking a lot

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
about bilingualism recently. It's like the reason that was in the pod cause last week was because we were both

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
on the road talking to people about just that at the start of the week we talk to each

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.000
other

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
to Hi Nina. I hate Thatcher.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We were speaking on the phone here but each of us recorded ourselves so hey presto. It sounded

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
like we were in the same room.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Nina though was in Hawaii and I was in the Netherlands because it was

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
the very first time that both of us were away from home base on palled business at the

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
same time. Well a phone call was in order a phone call

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
across eleven time zones my evening. Nina's morning.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Even though she didn't have to leave the US. It took her much longer to get to

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
her destination.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I got here yesterday afternoon it's such a blur Actually I

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
kind of walked around I walk to the beach and then went and had some

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
like noodles and basically then passed out. I'd like to have it.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
When did you get there.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Well I got here around about the same time that you did except it was eleven

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
hours before so I also got her yesterday afternoon but I've had a

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
whole extra day on the I've been out reporting all day today.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
The Dutch province where I was is called Friesland I know it sounds like a made

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
up name and the people there they speak Friesian I know I

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
know but it's true. I knew virtually nothing about the Friesian language

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
before I started researching the story.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
My first port of call this morning was a tri lingual school. Which is a totally

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
awesome thing in and of itself. So yeah this was a like a middle

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
school so Friesian

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
English that untouched Yeah. So they would learn you know part of the day in each language so

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
you know they'd learn geography in English

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and History in Friesian and then they do math. I think they do math

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
in a very kind of reminds me of dual immersion in back in the United States

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
where you know my

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
daughter is learning some of her math and civics in

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Chinese right now and then in England I wish she does for the other half of the

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
day English writing skills and I think they're doing some kind of like playing but

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
our science and stuff like

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
that so they have textbooks in these different subjects in Frege Yeah

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
yeah all of the curriculum in Friesian someone had to go through and translate all that was that's

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
pretty impressive.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Yeah there's only about three hundred thousand free agents. Because well I say only Actually that's quite a lot I think

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
it's a little bit more three hundred sixty something like that I realize that's more than the entire

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
population of Iceland. There's more people speaking Friesian. In the world than speaking

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Icelandic I

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
mean that's crass interest and. Well I came across I mean the thing that's interesting

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
about Hawaii or. If you want to say it right is that in

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
languages nearly everywhere like everybody says certain token phrases like Aloha

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Mahalo

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
like hello and thank you and immediately when I got off the plane there's all these different.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Hawaiian sayings in Hawaiian written all over the place but it is of far

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
fewer like actual fluent

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
speakers in the thousands. It's like sort of ubiquitous it's all over

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
like Hawaiian language you can feel it everywhere it influences like I was listening to

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
N.P.R. this morning the Hawaiian local station and even I was just curious the way that they

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
say all the islands in the way that they say all the place

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
names is definitely they say it in a why in a way but the actual language itself

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
is severely endangered. So it's kind of interesting that it's sort of all around and

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
sort of not here at the same

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
time. I think that region is almost the opposite of that it's so interesting that we're at

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
these two different. Sort of ends of the world and we're seeing things really differently.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
So with the Friesian zits

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
like yes you hear the language all over the place because people are speaking it everywhere especially once you

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
leave the city and you're in the small villages but you don't see bilingual

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
street signs you don't get the sense that you're in a bilingual part

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
of Europe. Like if you're

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
in the Basque Country or Switzerland or you know one of these places

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
where there's more than one language. At play.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
You see the signs everywhere that let it be known to you that. More than one language and

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
they're being taken very seriously by the authorities because they got these signs up everywhere. You know see that

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
here. It's all in Dutch Arsalan

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Friesian Yeah exactly it's all in one or the other. So somehow someone decided.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Several decades ago that the city was where Dutch because.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And the

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
villages and the farming communities where the Friesian speakers are so if you're

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
going to a village you see all the signs are in Friesian here in the city all the signs

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
are in touch.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
But let me know when I was at the school this morning I got followed

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
by a

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
T.V. crew. Well I had yeah it was a Freemason language T.V. crew and they made a

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
story out of like B.B.C. America reporter which is how they describe

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
me doing a story on Friesian Is there a lot of Friesian

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
language media yeah yeah yeah there

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
is a public broadcaster that you know has a news service and

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
clearly occasionally a scraping the barrel for stories to report

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
on and there's also freezing language radio interesting Lee with

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
the newspapers there are two newspapers but they're both Dutch

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
language kind of like the written language often defaults to Dutch which

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
is greatly to the annoyance of some Friesian

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
speakers there was a newspaper reporter and a photographer also showed up and asked me questions.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
What happens with that I have no idea it was like a news conference.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
What were they asking a Patrick like why do you care about this my anguish or what

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
were they. Yeah. Why do you care about language and you know I was likeable I'm here to

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
find out I was unable to tell them very much taller. So yeah it's

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
weird I'm I'm all over Friesian T.V..

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Famous for making the news while making the news but I'm not. I

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
can't claim to have gone to the beach or eaten noodles or anything fun

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
like well not yet you know you'll get your get your time to get

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
my sitting here like actually looking at the waves hitting the shores

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
of Calliope. I think I got the better day I don't know.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Nina. Felicity who one day will return from Hawaii. Maybe she's

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
still staring at those white.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
You know I'm sure she'll come back with a great story about the wise attempts to

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
go bilingual attempts that maybe one day will be as successful as those

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
present all of which let's make the man from the start of this podcast episode

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
of him the Brit must make him totally mad people all over the

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
world then making his beloved monolingual playing field a

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
little less

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
level and that is it for this book because we

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
