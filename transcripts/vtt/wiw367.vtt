00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is the world in words I'm you know. So back in

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
2011 people started posting these videos on YouTube

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where they would read a list of words and then answer specific questions to

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
test their accent.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hi everybody we want to do this for you for quite some time you know just

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because lots of people comment on my my love list Bush accent and the SO

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
when I saw that type of a cornet I thought of

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
these are the words and I'm not going in and say it for you so I'm just going to say them say

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
them you know it was on watch.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Sound work sound works from PR right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The world in words is made possible in part by a major grant from the National Endowment for the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Humanities.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Exploring the human endeavor the axent tag video blew up as a

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
meme. It's called an ax attack because usually at the end of each video the blogger

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
challenges or tags a friend or another YouTube subscriber

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to take the accent quiz and then it goes on and on. Tag you're it. Well

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
today there are more than 400000 of these videos and they're not just

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Americans. It has gone viral around the world. Writer Devin Ethan trace the origin of the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
accent tag me and she wrote about it for the online language Journal

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
fire. You should really check out surefire if you're interested in language at all. It's great and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
it's a relatively new journal up to link to it on our Facebook page. So

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
watched hundreds of these acts and videos in the course of all of her reporting

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and what you noticed was it wasn't just people simply taking a quiz.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It was actually more of a performance.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What this performance is supposed to do is make a comment on the kind of English that

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
they speak the kind of regional English or the dialect that they speak. And it really is kind of this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
fun proud performance of the different ways that people speak English. Linguists are

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
very impressed by this because most people who haven't studied

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
linguistics have what's called a prescriptivist that's a linguist say at a

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
prescriptivist view of the proper way to speak a language

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and they learn that in school and they learn that from all kinds of social pressure and there are

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
dialects in this country in any country really that are stigmatized and others

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that are held up to be the models.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And so when people say that they're going to speak their dialect on a YouTube

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
video that that's kind of unusual because they're not being prescriptive as they're being what language called

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
descriptivist which is what linguists are to linguists nothing's right and nothing's wrong.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So it's pretty impressive to see a lot of people just sort of being proud of the way they

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.000
talk.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm from New Zealand so might I say it's a little bit different but. Well I think it is I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
don't know what you guys think of course.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Do you know that I haven't actually.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Can you text because I like to think of the Finnish accent

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
as it's almost like the Russian accents

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
like flat depressed suicidal cousin.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This morning I decided not to actually type video. I wasn't talked but

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
you know then I have to take me as far as I'm concerned. I mean it.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And you actually went back and traced this meum and these questions because a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
lot of people when you see the videos they they're saying the exact same list of words corpus of words

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and then they have a specific list of questions. And you trace those

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
questions and what did you find when you dug into that.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Yeah I found out that doing with six professor who back in the 90s was at

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Harvard wanted to teach his students about the different

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
class and regional and ethnic dialects in the United States. He wanted to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
use the students themselves as models for that because he really couldn't find any material

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
available that was not a million years old and was old white farmers from way back.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So but then he was discouraged because by the time a student no matter

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
what isolated place their community they're from if they can get to Harvard. Really

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
really quickly they change their speech their speech becomes standard. So he

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
realize though that there's a lot of stuff even if that happens to you if you end up in an elite place like

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Harvard there is a lot of vocabulary a lot of ways of pronouncing words that you just don't

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
change. And there was vocabulary that you pick up in different parts of the country and

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
it never you know really occurs to you consciously or unconsciously to to change the vocabulary

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
so he came up with a really long list of words to pronounce and questions

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to answer. Then he put that list as a survey

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
on a Harvard Web site in 2002 and he was amazed that in the next

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
two years 60000 people took the survey.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is just phenomenal there's never been a linguistic survey that that many people participated in

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
where they post videos to him or how how are they just taking it writing

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
down their answers to the questions and that sort of thing at the time it was a multiple

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.000
choice.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It was just do you say C A R A L

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
with two syllables or with three syllables. And then you could

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
just check it off. Right. So you know. Carmel or caramel.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Exactly and I'm not I'm spelling the word for you. Although people got to see that word but you know

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I'm just going to spell it for you. How do you say it. How do you say I say I say Carmel

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Carmel. Yeah I think that's a southern thing. I'm not sure my mom was from Pittsburgh

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
but. You graduated in Euston So maybe there's a belt you know. I

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
don't really know maybe there is a line that got Arnold out of the Carmel caramel but

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
there probably is. Oh what was another one like that. OK our

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
roof. I also say Roof. My husband who's from Wisconsin says

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
if that was me got me exactly rough it's not rough it's more like

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
rough earth. So that's what that's what that list

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
evoked and what happened was so then another linguist put it on

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
his website in 2004 then about a year later.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Social media was born on the Internet and people

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
started putting stuff up on social media again. I mean there weren't any any videos

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
at that time people were just putting up these sort of checklist results. I just kind of

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
remained that way sort of checklists and sort of like filling in little circles you know or checking

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
off things and then discussing with people what your results were because the idea was that you could

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
tell where you were from. You know there'd be the single if you said these things like this then you're from

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
eastern Louisiana you know you're from Minnesota. And

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
then in 2011 all of a sudden some people started

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
reading the list and you know filming themselves and putting these videos

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
on YouTube. And that's when it really took off. Wow the power of YouTube.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Yes and it just became a performance I noticed that what

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
young women will often dress up when they do it. You know they'll be kind of having you know I mean it's a

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
performance they put on make up they were sort of nice clothes. Some of them will lie on a bad

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
to it if you know I have to say that I've watched a bunch of the.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And I think actually you sent me one of these.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
The woman who is knitting while she's doing it you just

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
cracked me up so much.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It's like sort of a lens into a whole other world. I felt watching

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
a bunch of these different tagged videos.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
My favorite ones are where you have a couple you know you have a couple who's clearly

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
romantically involved and it's like a date. And there's a lot of joking

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
going on and just a lot of good natured teasing. It's very very sweet

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
when two people have two different dialects and they get together and do it.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So this phenomenon hasn't just stayed in the United States it's kind of gone

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
global with the same. What I find interesting about it is the same corpus of

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
words in the same set of questions and they've gone global.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
You see this really strange kind of mismatch between.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
People who you know didn't grow up in the United States know some of them many of them are native

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
speakers but they're from places like Australia or Scotland or the Caribbean.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And you know English speaking countries in Africa likely be area. So there are a

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
lot of elements of U.S. culture that are on that list that just don't compute for

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
them. For example the stumps people is the

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
question What is it called when you throw toilet paper on a house.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So you know people are doing pretty good when they're just trying to pronounce Manet's or

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
through caramel but you know when they get to this question about the toilet paper now you

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
know most Americans they remember they remember putting toilet paper on a house right

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I always called it wrapping a house to go rent a house tonight let's have slumber party go

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
rent a house out of that tea peeing that's what I would you know.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Let's go t peeing.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Well these English speakers in other parts of the world don't have a clue.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I mean my entire life I've never had any foreign

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
countries. Not at all. So it's probably

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
obvious that I have a Chinese section and here comes the question

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
What is it called.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Well throw toilet paper. On the. House

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
that way. How do I try both in the house just really

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
gross. I so I have no idea what this question is about. So I

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
talked to her on the house.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I mean it does actually put. A fine lens on the act

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
of throwing a perfectly good toilet paper on somebody's house for a prank

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
is extremely wasteful and is also such a strange

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
cultural phenomenon as well.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It does make you think about what do we do why do we do that.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Yeah it's like definitely cultural interchange here. You know hearing other people from other

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
countries hearing their accent tags. Why do you think this went so viral. I think it went

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
really viral because people love to think about how they

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
speak. It's just you know it's a constant I think it's almost universal

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
cross-culturally people like to. Think about how they speak. Talk about

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
how they speak. Generally people make judgments about how other people

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
speak. And of course you know you speak so beautifully you sound so cultured.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Or that's just street talk that's like jargon that trash talk

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
that shows you're not educated and that's the way we're brought up you know in our grammar books I

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
remember when I was little there was something about you know never say he learned to

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
me. I remember things in my grammar books in seventh grade

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that my mom used and I was told this is wrong so that's called prescriptivism in

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
linguistics and people are brought up you know prescriptively in the popular culture about their

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
language. And you know so people are very at

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
the same. On the one hand insecure about their dialect and especially if

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
they come from marginalised regions or races or ethnic groups or classes and on the other

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
hand they're proud of how they talk especially these people who do the YouTube

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
videos they're proud and that's unusual.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I have watched I don't know I would say more than a dozen of them and they're saying the

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
same words and answering the same questions but they're highly entertaining to

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
watch. Even though it's the same thing over and over again but just seeing how people

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
react to the specific words. And if the scene had people from different cultures

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
react to the specific words there is something quite fascinating about it. It's

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
like watching the same play you know done.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
A million different times is a really good actor. Everybody's got their own style

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and I think the other thing that that you realize that you really get on a gut

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
level when you hear these and it doesn't really matter what country it is. Is that a

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
lot of these accidents never end up in the media in the mass media. We don't get to

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
hear them very much which I think is a shame. You know I think there are all kinds of

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
judgments made in the mass media about what gets on the air what gets on the radio and what

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
doesn't. And so it's really great to hear these accents I mean I've heard accents on

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
those YouTube videos that I've never heard. I have just never heard them. And it's

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
just wonderful I mean it's delicious to hear people speaking in cut and places of

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
the United States or the world right where you maybe you know the school the

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
language that you learned in school you know whether it's your native language or your foreign

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
language. But you've never heard people speak that way.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It's true. One of my favorites and I'll just end with this but is the Jamaican video and I think I send this

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to you and the girl. First of all she's very funny but she's like.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Now listen I'm just I mean. I live in Jamaica. Jimmy this is

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
my accent.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I live in Jamaica.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
This I mean you know some people say that to me

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
but they're not from demigod like their parents are from Jamaica. So they to me.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
That's not me. I am from here. I was born here. I've never been

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
outside of Jamaica for a period longer than for a week.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I live here you know and the accent that I have would

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
be a Jamaican accent because I mean to me. This is my accent.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Jimi accent.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
U.S. U.S. U.S. apparently she got a lot of comments like You don't sound Jamaican but she

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
keeps pointing to the room. This is Jamaica. I am Jamaican.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
This is the way I speak.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And it was really nice and I think what I got out of

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that was that there are stereotypes about how people speak how people with

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
certain dialect speak their received stereotypes. And that's not really the

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
way they speak necessarily. You know there's all kinds of right even in a

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
dialect depending on people's educational level depending on you know who else they hang

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
out with. So it's really great to hear somebody like her say

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
I am Jamaican. This is how I speak. Take it or leave

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
it guys.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So final question have you done one of these acts and tag videos.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I know I know I'm too old. What do you mean you're too

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
old.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I think you have to be. I mean I've never seen one that has anybody over the age of about

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
25. It's a youth culture deal.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Maybe you need to start the viral like I don't know how old the senior citizens accents

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
act senior citizens from Houston at AX a tag a phenomena

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
right. Yes. OK take that under advisement.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Writer Debbie Nathan on the origins of accent tagging and I'm going to post a

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
link to her article she wrote a really interesting detail article about

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
these origins on the language journaled Shaw fire.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I'll link to that on the Facebook page the world Mort's Facebook page. Thanks so much Debbie I really

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
appreciate it. It was great thank you.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Bird is his name. Yeah how are you.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Are you good if you just would in a complete sentence introduce yourself.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I am bird Vox. I am a professor at the University of Cambridge in England

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and I developed a dialect survey that was the

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
origin of the You Tube accent main About 15 years ago.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Your last name is spelled v a you X but it's really pronounced Fox.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Yep neurons of hawks in my dialect that is amazing and in radio

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
parlance we always use the vox pop.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Yeah I can already tell where you're from roughly Nina by your pronunciation of that

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
phrase really.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Yeah that was going to be the last part I was going to test you and I was going to do your very own I mean

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
it's not quite the tester that you created but a variant of it.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Well first I'm going to hold off. It's probably pretty apparent where I'm from. But

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
when your quiz was put online it were you a bit surprised that was as

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
popular as it was.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I had hoped that that many people would catch on because I was convinced that

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
the questions were really interesting they had always compelled me

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
growing up. And one reason for it. Thinking that was there was a one question survey

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
designed by Alan McConnachie at Cal Tech. That was just for a Coke and soda

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and hundreds of thousands of people had taken that one question survey. And

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
so there was some evidence that people were willing to take that kind of thing.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Growing up you said you were interested in these kinds of questions What things did you notice growing up about the

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
way different American spoke that made you curious.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
It was a product of growing up in Houston Texas with a dad who is from

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
New York and a mother who is from Indiana and then moving to Chicago when I was

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
nine. So for example I noticed that I always like to use you

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
all to address a group of people. And I noticed when we moved to Chicago that you

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
guys was what they used. And when we moved. Say England when I was 13.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I was made fun of for those and they used you lot instead.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And I remember being confused when we moved to Chicago that they

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
said Pop where I was used to saying Coke. You know when you're a little kid you don't

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
realize that it's strange to call all carbonated beverages coke. It's

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
just what you say and moving around made me start thinking about these things and having a

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
mother who said lawyer instead of lawyer got me interested in that kind of

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
variation that distinguishes the middle and southern parts of

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Indiana from what you would hear in Chicago in the northern cities.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Well so essentially moving around as a kid and being the product of so many different places

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
you parenting from different places but you're on the path to becoming a linguist.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Yeah definitely and also living in Germany when I was three and

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
being around Spanish in Texas has got me really interested in how languages can

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
differ.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Has anything surprising come out of these videos that you as a linguist didn't expect or

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
has made you reconsider certain issues or certain things about pronunciation of

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
products.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
I've been shocked at how many people who aren't native speakers of

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
English been willing to do the accent tag.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And I'm always interested in what non-native speakers will pick

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
for a word choice in terms of whether those they're British in origin or American in

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
origin and where exactly in the US or Britain they come from.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
It is incredible that this medium has spread globally that

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
has lots to say both about English in the world and maybe about YouTube in the world.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
But what it also points to me is just how culturally specific the

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
questions that you had.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yes good point. I designed the questions originally for the United States in

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
particular. I have a new set of questions as designed and for

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
English speakers around the world. So there you have things more like what do you call the break

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
you use in a car with manual transmission. You know what that's called

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
like a hand brake. Yeah. So hand brake parking brake e-brake

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
they are speakers of English across the whole world will have a term. Interestingly though

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
there are a few phrases that show up across the world regardless of

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
native language like some of my Chinese students today were telling me

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
that they often hear oh my God used inside Chinese

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
conversations.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Wow. What's been the most surprising thing to come out of this mean for

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
you personally.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
For me it's mainly a psychological effect it's very bizarre to

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
hear hundreds of thousands of random people across the globe

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
answering questions that I came up with when I was in my 20s that were based

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
on my college friends making fun of me for what I call things or

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
based on weird things my mother or my dad said to me their sort of private things from my

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
past. And now they've gone across the entire world which is a little

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
bit disturbing but I guess nice have you done one

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
yourself. No I'm a little bit afraid of what people would

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
make of me because I have an idiosyncratic accent. Which

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
is partly from growing up in Houston and Chicago and then Boston and

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
then England and partly from being an academic so it's sort of

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
nerdy. And then it's partly sort of autistic and monotonous which

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
there are features that are independent of particular regions. So I'm not sure if

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
people would know what to make of my accent other than to be disturbed by it.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
But that's the whole point of the accent had video or it seems like one of the points is to declare

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
loudly is the way I speak.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And I'm proud of it. Yeah that's a good feature of it isn't it. I

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
would like to do it and then give my linguistic comments on each of the

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
answers so that people could see that the whole thing is. Not just a joke

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
and it's not just a popular fad that actually has some intellectual content

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
to it that interested people maybe one of these days I'll get around to it.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I hereby tag you and you need to do that yeah No one's ever attacked me you know.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Do you mind if I take the test. Will you go. How do you analyze my accent.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
First of all I would like to preface this with the fact that I don't think I have an accent. Ha.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
OK so here are the words Aunt roof route.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Wash oil theater iron salmon Carmel fire

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000

Pekin AP can. I don't know that one's hard. Both Again

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000

coupon Menezes sirup pajamas cops

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
naturally aluminum and follow up and the questions are What

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
is it called when you throw toilet paper onto a house what's called T peeing in.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Where I'm from. What is the bug that when you touch it curls into a

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
ball the rollie pollie. What is the bubbly carbonated

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
drink called soda. What do you call gym shoes. Probably

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
tennis shoes sometimes sneakers. It really would depend around who I

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
was around. What do you say to address a group of people. Probably

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
you guys. What do you call the kind of spider or spider like creature that has an oval

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
shaped body and extremely long legs Daddy Long Legs. What do you call your

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
grandparents. Well I called my paternal grandparents Nana and

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
pop up. I only had a maternal grandma and I called her grandma.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
What do you call the wheeled contraption in which you carry groceries at the supermarket. A shopping

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
cart. What do you call it when rain falls while the sun is shining. This one I

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
like but I learned this later in life. A Monkey's wedding. That's what I like.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
What is the thing that you change the TV channel with a remote control and the last

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
one I have a question was What else would you call it besides a room a collector maybe.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
You know there are a few terms I didn't actually come up with that question and the one thing in

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
the accent tag that I didn't come up with. OK so how did I do

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
that you largely had the responses that most Americans

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
give you have a few things that would help localize you to the

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
western half of the country. Yet when you pronounced VEO X

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
for a voice box. Yeah that shows what we call the cot caught

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
merger which merged in the particular way you pronounced it is

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
characteristic of the western half of the US. You also had

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Carmel do I remember correctly at our inner 0 instead of caramel. Yeah.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
So that again would mark you as being from the western half of the country in all

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
likelihood And what about a road that you go fast on the freeway

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
already you're starting to seem like you're from the West

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Coast in particular.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
You might not be able to like actually listen to people often because you're hearing all these different.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
That's exactly right. Well by the way you said monkey's wedding accident

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
tag that is primarily found in South Africa

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
and Zimbabwe in English. Really. So you must have picked it up from

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
someone from one of those two places I'm guessing.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Yeah that's that's funny I might have. Yeah I might have. I have a colleague who also spent time

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
in South Africa and I think she said that once and I picked that up from her. I had never

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
had a term for that before and I thought oh cool. Now I have a new term.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
That's one of the coolest phrases in the world as a whole actually so

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
in the south of the U.S. there are a lot of people who have variants of the Devils beating his wife like

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
the devil's beating his wife behind the back door or the devil's beating his wife with a

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
codfish. And you also find that same expression in parts of

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
France and in parts of Syria you find Fox's wedding in Japan

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
and parts of Wales and the list goes on and on it's normally some kind of wedding

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
or some kind of giving birth. Kind of unexpected animal or human

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
like a widow or a witch.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Well so your then diagnosis is that I'm from the west.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Yes and you know if I give any terms that would localize you more than the

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
west coast I can ask you a few more things. Sure it might help. So one that is

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
very good for outing people from Oregon is what does the word

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Spend be mean.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Oh I have no idea. And Oregon that means expensive. Oh really.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
That's very cute.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
And so within California the main ones I

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
tend to rely on with regular people are what you call the

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
freeways like the 405 and the 5 and so on. You know about that

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
yeah.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Yesterday you say well I would say PCH and I would say the

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
405.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
OK so that would mark you as being from the southern half of California I would

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.000
guess.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Corr ect.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Yeah I get in trouble a lot or I've gotten lots of weird looks

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
because I currently live in Boston for saying the 90. Yeah everybody's

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
like what is the 90 It's the pattern or the pike. Oh yeah.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
I've got a lot of funny looks sometimes for that. Well Bert Fox thank

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
you so much for giving me the accent quiz. It's not often that one

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
gets to meet the person who sparks something that goes viral.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Well it definitely helps me feel better about my relations with my classmates from

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
college from when they made fun of me for saying gym shoes instead of

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
sneakers and Coke instead of pop and soda. Thanks

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Nina. And you are right that you don't have all that many

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
West Coast features left anymore.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Yeah it's sad that's what happens after living for 10 years on the east coast sort of

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
wipes it all out.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
But you know what about when you turn your car around

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
on the road to go the opposite direction and you do it very suddenly What would you call that.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Like a sudden U-turn. Yeah.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
More colloquially than that flip a bitch. That's what I think

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
is that happened. That's it. Is that it. Yeah that's the

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
California term.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Oh OK. Oh I feel so I am part of it.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Part of the place.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
I have another one for you like that. The middle seat on a car what do you call it.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Oh you call that the bitch too.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Yeah.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
So that's mainly in California that's not everywhere not everybody thinks of that as like I don't

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
have such a bad term.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Do you always feel a little naughty saying it. Well Bert

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
thanks so much I really appreciate your time.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
You know that's for calling me in a nice chatting with you.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Linguist Bert Fox. Yes folks it doesn't get better than that.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
His original dialect survey sparked the accent tag mean that went

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
viral around the world. Do you have a few minutes to burn. I

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
strongly suggest you go to youtube and just type in accent tag.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Watch a couple videos they're pretty addicting. And then maybe do the quiz yourself.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Consider yourself attacked and that's all for today. Keep sending me your Adam a

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
logical questions but nagging questions you have about the origins of a certain word

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
writer and linguist Erika Grant has graciously said she would answer all of your

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
etymological questions. So keep sending them in. We're collecting a bunch now so we can do

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
a bigger pod cast about that soon. Message me at the world inwards Facebook page or

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
you can even call 6 1 7 9 0 3 8 8 1 8 6 1 7

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
9 0 3 8 8 8 1 8. I'm you know I'm on Twitter

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000

Thanks for listening. Be back soon.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
What is it called when you first try to find one of us. When you want to

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
deny. Yourself for joy you know. Corny I

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
know. Yes I can. That's.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.000
The same. Right sound work sound work for NPR.
