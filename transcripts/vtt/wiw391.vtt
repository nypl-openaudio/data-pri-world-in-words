00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My dream is to be able one day to go on stage in

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
English in a comedy club here for ten

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
minutes and do my thing in

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
angling to get the reaction from talking

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
English

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and allows me to bring

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
him here and your listening to the world and words that was the Moroccan

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
French comedian aghast. Elmo was with

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Jerry Seinfeld in the web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I mentioned Garrett in a pod cast several weeks ago is a big deal in France.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
He does shows in big arenas for thousands of people and then he gave it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
all up to come to the U.S. where he is relatively

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
unknown and tried to do standup in English a language. He is still learning.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So for many months he's been touring around the country performing in small clubs some of which are

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so small like

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Johnny's here in the Boston area that he could even touch the ceiling.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And that's where Osama few weeks ago. He also dropped by the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
studio when you get a laugh in English. Even in front of one hundred people. It's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
wow it's feels really

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
good GED has been documenting his English language journey. He recently put out

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a short film ten minutes in America in the film he gets advice from the likes of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Jerry Seinfeld and Sarah

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Silverman was like I want to go build a car but I want to build it in Germany.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
OK And he was a really in Germany then I'm going to go to Italy and I'm helping up a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
pasta factory and then we're going to France I want to make wine. OK All right OK And then I'm

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
going to England and I'm going to write someplace.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
OK Right. And then I'm going to go to America and I'm going to

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
do standup comedy. Yeah so those people are used to the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
bass plays in England wine in France cars

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in Germany pass in Italy almost the most of Morocco.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You know you see the lot with. We don't of course.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
OK we don't have any theories anyway it doesn't

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
matter

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
if it was me honestly. It was me and I had what you had in France I would you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.000
would

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
say

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you have to start all over you're starting over you go into little round you do a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
little bit of time. Five ten minutes. You have to use

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the first of all no English.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Oh yeah I know English but my english is not excellent but I think I just had

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
translate. That it's not just translating I mean you have to have to craft

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
a joke you have to your human need some years to figure it out only

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to come out here and do like a two

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
thousand person a no no I didn't know it yet

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
anyway

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
so there is right and GAD normally knows. Comedy is not just a matter

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of translation in the beginning when I got here in the U.S. I said you know what I have a great show.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It's a ninety minutes in in France in France got killed

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
every night. It's great I'm going to translate that so I worked with the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
English teachers in a translate in my math surreal and they immediately realized that was

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
not at all what I needed to do for example I had many jokes

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
about you know when you go to the restaurants. It's the air conditioning

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and it's freezing and then the first thing they do they bring you a glass with ice

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
water why do they why would they do this we don't so French people they were laughing a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
lot and then I did this in a comedy club one night and Americans were like just this

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
is you know this is what we

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
do this week. Gads dream that he spoke about while getting coffee with Jerry

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Seinfeld is becoming even more of a reality. His first English language show.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Oh my. Gad. Yes he is. A fan of the pond is opening in

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
New York

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
City to be honest like two years

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
ago I could never imagine that I would be able

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to do a show a whole show in English. And even a

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
home conversation. Now you can go to very fluent I mean

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
now because you don't know but in New York I wake up every

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
morning and I have two hours

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
lessons lesson the same lesson of English with my English

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
teacher every morning two hours every morning and every morning

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I think to that. Yeah.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Now on your T.V. set. Yes yes told

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
told go and tell God you want me to do the yes to same

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
be told really.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
How can I do this in my eyes that we

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
have to stop every minute and would like to have you know you got to be a joke in you having to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Yap every minute.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Dad was born in Casablanca Morocco. He speaks four languages

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Arabic French Hebrew and now English was Arabic your first

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
language

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
French French a little girl in French so in the house he spoke French here in

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Arabic both Alyami and Morocco. You know I spoke to two languages and I

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
learned Hebrew in Morocco. It's a hard language but.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Surprisingly it's very close from Arabic. Yeah there's a lot of the same odd name

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
roads and same it's very connected. So you know in Hebrew so you spoke all of those in the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
how yeah yeah. Of those languages but I mean mainly French you know

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and then I learned

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
English. I started to learn very seriously English just like two years ago.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Oh really really. Like seriously. I used to speak like

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
this and but the most difficult

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
thing with the English is to grammar the tenses. You

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
know and it's exhausting. No I'm talking to you I'm

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
happy but I'm going to go home and take a nap. Oh yeah because my

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
brain is consistently working trying to

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
translate what I want to say from the French to the English. I was

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
your French. There is no fun. You took two years of French you know I took I

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I I never you're going to make it so Spanish Yeah that's good.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
OK OK. What was the first joke that you ever told ending

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
which allow it was kind of an impression of

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Americans because everyone keeps asking me why did you want to do to stand up in English that

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
your language is going to be

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
hard and I said I always give them a very American on sir.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And it's not a joke it's more of a little citation.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So I. When people ask me why do you want to do your standup in English I said you know I

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
need to challenge

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
myself. But I was so I had

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
no idea I don't

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
know and they're right the swear to god I don't think

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Jerry Seinfeld with Go to do

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
those I must say and

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
today I want to just post was the first thing is the challenge in

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
my cellphone from say no you have to be crazy to do

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that and it was like the first

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
tryout the first time I would try something in English were you

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
scared I was very scared but I want you know it was like a strategy very

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I started my

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
shows in French for French experts in the beginning in the U.S. than

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I you know put it up a T. I used a little by little I put some English in

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
my act and then more and more anguish and then I did the whole show in

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
English when you're doing stuff in English. Do you feel like a different person a different kind

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
of comedian are you still doing observational humor and the same way you do in France.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I think I'm

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
a different comedian. Let me explain that to you in my shows in friends.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I love to do jokes

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
about self deprecating this is how you say deprecation your

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
self

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
deprecation talking about the fact that you're famous but you still have this problem

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
this problem this is annoying this

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is obviously I can not use all these make any here because they don't know

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
me laugh to change my whole act. I write jokes

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
about coming to America doing the stand up my perspective

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
on Americans. The difference between you know French cab drivers

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and American cab drivers in airports

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and everyday life you know you've been traveling all across the US yelling

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
this and yeah I'm wondering what preconceptions you had about the U.S. that totally were blown out of the water.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I like this expression blow in blown out of the water so totally blown out of

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
the water flowing out of the

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
water interesting because you know what I had so many cliches. You know

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I had saved two conceptions pre-conception and they went all

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
wrong like you know the cliche about Texas is not true.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I'm not quite sure exactly which Texas cliche Gadd was referring

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
to perhaps it's along lines of what the Norwegian the Iranians think about

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the over the top crazy wild Texas. We've got a whole pod cast about

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that which I'll link to you but back to gad and cliches A little

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.000
backstory for a

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
second a few weeks ago after I watched Gads that I met him after the

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
show and he asked me first and

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
feedback and I was honest there was one joke about an Indian cab driver in New

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
York City that felt well. For lack of a better word

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
two obvious. Speaking of cliches. Yeah I remember the joke that I could take from

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
your Of course I mean talk a little bit about that of course so I yeah of

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
course I really thought. About it a lot. Well first we got

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
to set it up the gist of the joke was poking fun at the fact that the cabbie was on the phone speaking another

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
language while driving a cab and GAD mimics the sound of the cabbie's

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
language and for a guy that spends a good portion of the night talking about his own struggles

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
in a foreign tongue the joke kind of just fell off the mark and I told

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
him so and you thought that I was being really P.C. and that's the reason

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
why you are pretty I like this B. C. just this letter is right I

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
AM NOT A Z

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
D I D. You know pretty it when you know what P.D.F.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
public displays of the phone you know I just learned last week was really I

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
was with a girl in a subway in New

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
York doing P.T.A. I wanted to do it she was in and you ask her that

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
way can I do P.T.A. know I started to do something and she said she was not

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
into P D

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
A And what did you say I thought about the

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Singur but it was P.D. has nothing to do with BT A and B.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
the it's weird Is there an expression for P.T.A. in French. No it's

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
just

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
living. It's life. It's just being a

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
life so I did the job. Well

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
you know you know all of that you know you do NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO I said in our podcast that it

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
was set up.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
You didn't joke about cabdrivers and your yeah I know to make an Indian accent.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Yeah which I found easy. You know that was the whole critique but it's a reality.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
It's a reality sure I thought rather than really funny.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I was thinking about that because I've been thinking about this for years longer than I She is my writer now she's

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
my comedy writer my my partner and I were thinking honestly like a long time reeling back. How would

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
it be like super funny if he started to suddenly turn to you and completely

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.000
unaccented

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
English told you know. Or maybe maybe that would be funny if he speaks French.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Oh yeah oh yeah sounds exactly like that would be like so yes exactly that would be a good.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
With their need it just means yeah I know it's a twisted need to get him ready to

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
be self-deprecating. And I think that this I like it. This I buy that but I'm going to try

small city and said doctor. I'm so

So it's going to be fine and the guy looked at the doctor and said I am but

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
my story. This is all. Someone really needs

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
so sweet freezing everywhere.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
It's freezing everywhere

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
while in France we spend hours sitting at a table at

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
the restaurant. We link your we feel those of. Why we

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
talk with say.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
In America they do but when you're dong the grabbed your plate

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
so far I don't know how they synchronize that maybe to

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
have cleaning the kitchen you know it's something with multi comes on your face isn't a manager in

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
the kitchen

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
takes table fourteen laughter by table

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
fourteen on your mind get ready Scott told the

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
bank but it didn't before they got to play the

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
attitude. This is my favorite question. My favorite line of all in America

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
are used to working

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
off.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I mean worst gig because you're in America everything is a

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
job when you do

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
the stand when you go really close to you as you do

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the tour there is something

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
very simple in the stand up comedy.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Like I experienced something that I cannot experience anymore in

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
France yesterday night I walked

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
out from the venue and I did a little video that I posted

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
on Instagram for my friends fans. I was walking alone in the

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
streets of

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Boston and I said I guys I mean Boston just did a show in English on

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
the loan in the streets but I'm excited it's OK I'm

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
starting over. It's like this you gotta be alone. There's no crew there is

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
no security bodyguards and three yes cisterns and

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
the driver and whatever you have when you're on tour

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and and I like it. This simple thing that I'm experiencing now. I

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
like it you know just what matters. What's the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
most important thing essential is your jokes your

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
material your writing.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
There is no Shante the Seante like.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Topping say that they are all wrinkles. Yeah this is just super flu this

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
is just the paraphilias you know there's nothing I was not

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
expecting to like it like that you know I thought it was going to be March stressful

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
more stressful.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So basically you had to leave your country and your language to kind of find yourself again yet

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
to find what's funny in your I mean

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
again you know and you know and I try

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
to to be

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
immersed emerged or immersed I don't know immersed I hope you know year

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
from now.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
My English will be really really good one year

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I allow myself one

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
year and during that year. You got to learn French. Well you know I

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
give you want to hear what's it's one year I write

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.000
two

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
years. I think I need a lifetime. I think I need to move there.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I think that's the key right is moving to a place like now that you're so you know I very day. Yeah I

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
think if you're surrounded by just English speakers. It's going very fast.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
You have no choice improving in the language you don't

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
have to judge yourself it's hard I know it's hard because I want to do good. I want to

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.000
sound

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
good but it's OK if you make mistakes you know now I started to

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
be more tolerant with myself I used to not talk because I didn't

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.000
have the

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
right phrase with the good words and know it just take risks

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
on OK just talk they will understand they know you're not from here. It's OK. Doesn't matter

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
you don't have it exactly the way we should say it's

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
OK I imagine that if you get to a certain level of

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
fame and you are doing observational comedy then he's sometimes have a hard

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
time connecting and observing in the world. That's kind of

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
been you kind

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
of sort of trying to keep the world away and then you're trying to also observe the world. Yeah.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So that's hard I feel like. Maybe this opens up a new way of observing the

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
world thought only you

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
said what I would like to say but do with a good English.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Gad thanks so much for coming in so much what language is next Chinese That's the next language you have to learn and

And speaking of the New English. That is

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Chinese the world in words is big possible in parts

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
by the National Endowment for the

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
excellence that is the voice of Patrick's mother in

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
law and I'll let him explain the origins of her accent.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
So we know that my mother in law. Connie MAOIs Chinese here's the really

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
interesting thing and I actually I didn't know all of these details until I asked us to record

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
this she was born and spent the first few years of her life

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
in southern China Guangdong where they speak Cantonese so that was mother

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
tongue that was her first language. She then moved when she was about ten

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
years old to Sichuan province

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
and what would you call that the west of the center of China.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And she learns that Sichuan was. Which is such one dialect.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
So that was a second language such One was she then moved to the United

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
States with her family when she was

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
seventeen she had picked up a little bit of Mandarin the

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
quote national language of China along the way but she really was

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
not particularly conversant in it she says that she learned most of it in the

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
United States.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
So it's a very particular. Accent. She had she she described it to

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
me as a combination of Cantonese and

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Sichuan

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
